          Set a display picture in Slack like everyone else. 
          The last thing we want is a faceless community, so this is really important to us.

          You should also set your preferred name and a quick bio.
          A simple way to write a useful bio is to have a sentence on your background and list your hobbies.

          This consistent theme amongst AiCore graduates stands out and has been seen to attract more attention from recruiters and those hiring.

          It also looks professional.

          You can download the orange background <a href="https://aicore-files.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring-process/Profile+Background.png" download="Profile Background.png">here</a>.

          Make sure to download the LinkedIn banner <a href="https://aicore-files.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring-process/LinkedIn+Banner.png" download="Profile Background.png">here</a>.
