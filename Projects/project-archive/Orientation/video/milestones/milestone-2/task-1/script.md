- The main tool that you will use throughout your journey at AiCore is the Portal
- it's the place for you to see your next tasks, access the content, and request support

- so let me show you around
- you can access the portal at portal.theaicore.com
- you should have recieved login credentials via email
- this is the homepage
- the main thing you can access on this page is the link to the current scenario which you're going to be finding yourself in
- above it, you can see an outline of the journey that you're going to take
- and below it, you can see your other scenarios once you've completed them
- on top, you've got the "support button" which I will talk about shortly
- on the left, you've got the navbar which gives you access to

  - the homepage
  - to the handbook, where you can find some useful links to things like the calendar
  - to your current scenario
  - and to the content library, where you can access all of \*our learning documentation, demos, and explanations

- let's head into the current scenario

<!-- THE PROJECT PAGE -->

- this main thing on this page is the project milestones

_Collapse all milestones_

_Scroll up and down the milestones_

_Expand a milestone_

- and those milestones are split into tasks

_Scroll up and down the tasks_

- above each task, you'll see a card which contains any prerequisite content that that you should be comfortable with in advance and that hasn't been encountered in the project so far
- i'll come back to that in a second
- so when you click on a task card, it expands to show the description of how you should approach it
- some of the tasks are challenging, so we keep an updated list of the most common issues and solutions to guide you in handling them
- if you hit this text, you'll see the card expand to show a number of common issues and solutions
- once you've completed a task, you can check it off by hitting the checkbox

<!-- PREREQUISITE CONTENT -->

- so let's say that you read about something that you're not familiar with about in one of the tasks, or need to refresh your knowledge on
- that would be the right time to check out the prerequisite content
- hit the card to expand it
- if you see something you know you're already comfortable with, then you can check it off from here
- but most likely it will be something that you want to learn, in which case, you can click into it to reach the lesson page

_Click on one of the lesson cards_

<!-- LESSON PAGE -->

- in here, you'll find a video explanation and demo
- below that, are related common issues and their solutions, if any have been identified
- then you'll find the study guide, which gives suggested guidance of other links to check out and an order to do things in
- below that, you can hit the button to access the notebook

_Open notebook_

- the notebooks are our form of documentation that intertwine written explanations with code

_Scroll just a little_

_Close the notebook_

- the last thing that you'll find on the lesson page are any suggested practicals
- these are not required, but can be good practice
- expand them to read the instructions in detail
- and mark them as complete once you're done

_Expand a practical and mark it as complete_

_Scroll to the top_

- once you're happy with your understanding of the content, you can mark it as complete using the checkbox at the top

_Check off the lesson to mark it as complete_
