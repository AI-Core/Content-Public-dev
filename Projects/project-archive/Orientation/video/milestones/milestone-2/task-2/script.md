- of course, we are here to help
- there is something that I really need to make clear
- that is that the best engineers don't need someone to tell them what to do to solve every problem they get
- the key skill they have is being able to find things out for yourself so that you can keep making progress when you face a problem that nobody else has seen before which is going to be ALL THE TIME
- and this is the most important skill that you need to master
- there are four steps to it
- 1. try to debug the problem for yourself
- I will talk about how to do this in much more detail shortly
- 2. look up the issue
- it's likely someone else has seen it before, and posted about it on the internet
- you going to learn how to do this effectively
- 3. ask one of your peers
- just ask "Can you help me take a look at this issue I'm having?" and they will be happy to help
- we're all here to help, and we expect you to help others in return
- it's also a great excuse to network with other members of the community
- you'll learn a lot from helping others
- 4. hit the support button in the navbar of the portal
- we'll reach out to you through slack, and then meet you on video if we need to
- so those are the 4 steps
  _Count them on your fingers_
- try to debug it yourself, look it up, ask a peer, hit the support button
- so remember those steps
- we are going to keep reminding you of them anyway
- the amazing thing is that the more you do this, the easier it gets, and the more complex challenges you'll find yourself able to handle without leaning on someone else
