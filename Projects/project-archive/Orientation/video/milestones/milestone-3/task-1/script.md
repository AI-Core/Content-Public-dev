- so, every Mon-Thu we meet up on our virtual campus on Zoom from 6:30 to 9:30, British time
- you aren't required to attend those but they are a good place to hang out
- and in those meetups there is usually a number of things going on
- the main thing is that members of the community are each working on their projects, and supporting each other when they need it
- but there are also other things like talks from industry experts, online socials, or demonstrations
- if you want to know what's happening at any point, just check out the calendar, which is linked in this task description
- when you join a meetup, you'll first find yourself in the lobby
- now some people get confused here and think that they are the only ones in the call
- but that's because everyone else is in a breakout room, unless you've joined at the same time they are in the lobby
- just hit the breakout room button and you can see the different rooms
- they are named after what's going on in each of them
- most of them are named after the scenario which the members are working in
- most of the time, it's good to be in the room corresponding to the one you're currently working on
- there are also other rooms for things like presentations, interest groups, or just socialising
- there's even a room for working in silence when you really want to zone into a problem
- we do find that the people who become the strongest engineers spend most time working alongside other members of the community on each of their own projects in these groups sharing their code and talking through issues together
- but whatever your preference or pace, there should be a room for you
- the only thing that we ask is that you try to keep your camera on and participate if you do decide to attend
