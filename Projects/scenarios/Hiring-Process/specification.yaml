          Once you've updated your CV based on the most recent feedback, upload it again using the same form linked above.

          Let recruiters work for you. Let them know you are seeking a role, and they will help you.

          The secret here, is to CALL recruiters. Call them. Do not give them the chance to ignore you via email or LinkedIn.

          When you get on the phone with them for the first time, you can use the following script

          """
          Hi, I'm looking for a role in data engineer/ML engineer/data scientist.

          I have experience in building <DESCRIPTION OF YOUR DATA COLLECTION PROJECT>, <DESCRIPTION OF YOUR SPECIALISATION PROJECT>

          I'm not looking for an entry level role as I already have experience in building industry grade systems.

          I have experience with AWS, Docker, writing industry grade code, testing and much more.

          I'm looking for around Â£40K or more.
          """

          It is important to mention the specific tools you've used, such as Spark, Docker, and AWS.
          Mention as many of these as you can without droning on, but avoid mentioning ONLY basic ones like Python, Git.

          The more you can mention about tools used to deploy production systems, like testing, containerisation etc, the better.

          Firstly, make a list of the recruiters you have connected, then create a weekly recurring calendar event to call them.

          You need to be persistent.

          - Companies may post a job in 10 different places (e.g. LinkedIn, Otta, Cord etc), but they typically only check one place actively. This is typically the same place that they have listed on their main website - apply here. 
          - Quality over quantity. Making 300 applications with LinkedIn's 1-click apply never works in practice. People who do this have the lowest conversion from application to interview. Be intentional about where you want to go.

          This isn't something that you can just do once. You need to be persistent.

          Do not get discouraged. Many people end up having to apply for dozens of jobs.
          Hiring functions within companies can be brutal and blind to good talent.
