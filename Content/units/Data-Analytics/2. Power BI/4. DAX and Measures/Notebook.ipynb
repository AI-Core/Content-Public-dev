    "> *DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)* is a powerful formula language used in Power BI's Model View and Report View to derive new features and insights from the existing data in your model. It employs a collection of functions, operators, and constants that can be combined to build formulas for defining measures, calculated columns and calculated tables.\n",

    "## DAX Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntactic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A DAX expression starts with an equal sign `=` and is followed by functions, operators, constants, or references to other elements. Here's a simple breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Equal Sign (`=`):** Every DAX formula begins with an equal sign.\n",
    "- **Function:** Most DAX expressions one of the array of 200+ functions in the DAX library, for example `SUM()`, `AVERAGE()`, or `COUNT()`\n",
    "- **Operators:** DAX uses operators to perform arithmetic, comparison, and text operations\n",
    "- **Constants:** DAX expressions can also contain static values, e.g. numbers like `5` or text strings enclosed in double quotes like `\"Product\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Referencing in DAX\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tables:** Just use the table name to reference a table. For example: `Orders`\n",
    "- **Columns:** Reference a column by enclosing the table name and column name in square brackets. For instance: `[Order Date]` or `Orders[Order Date]`\n",
    "- **Measures:** When referencing measures, use the measure name directly or with the table name. Example: `[Total Sales]` or `Orders[Total Sales]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "DAX includes a variety of operators, some of the most common ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`\n",
    "- **Comparison Operators:** `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `<>` (not equal to)\n",
    "- **Text Concatenation:** Use the `&` operator to combine two text strings.\n",
    "- **Logical Operators:** `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `NOT`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nesting Functions:** DAX expressions can be nested, meaning you can use the result of one function as the argument of another, e.g., `SUMX(FILTER(Orders, Orders[Unit Price] > 100), Orders[Number of Items])`.\n",
    "2. **Context Awareness:** Always remember that DAX formulas are context-aware. They'll change their result based on the filter and row context.\n",
    "3. **Comments:** In DAX, you can include comments in your code using `//` for single-line comments or `/* */` for multi-line comments. This is useful for documentation and understanding complex formulas later.\n"

    "## Measures in DAX\n",
    "\n",
    "In Power BI, a **Measure** is a calculation that’s performed on data in the data model. The calculation is the result of evaluating a DAX expression, and to be a measure, this must evaluate to a single value, as opposed to a calculated column, which will evaluate to a single value per row in the source table. Measures are used to calculate results \"on the fly\" as the user explores and interacts with visuals on Power BI reports. This means that a measure will obey the filter context in which it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, let's look at a simple example. Say we hade an order table, whose head 5 rows look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Order ID | Order Date | Number of Items | Unit Price | Product ID |\n",
    "|----------|------------|-----------------|------------|------------|\n",

    "| 1002     | 01/02/2023 | 1               | $50        | P002       |\n",
    "| 1003     | 01/03/2023 | 3               | $100       | P001       |\n",
    "| 1004     | 01/04/2023 | 4               | $40        | P004       |\n",

    "\n",
    "We could define a simple DAX measure for the total number of orders, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate to the Power BI Fields list and select the appropriate table.\n",
    "- Right-click and choose **New measure**.\n",

However, as measures obey filter context, this same measure could be used as the Y-axis value in a bar chart visual showing the count of orders for each Product ID. For each bar in the chart, the filter context would be the specific product ID for that bar.\n",

    "## Calculated Columns in DAX\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Calculated Column** is a custom column added to a table in your data model. For every row in the table, the calculated column has a value that is the result of a DAX formula. The formula is evaluated once for each row, considering the row context.\n",

    "### Let's Dive In With an Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the order table provided:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If we wanted to determine the total price for each order, we could create a calculated column named `[Total Price]`. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate to the Power BI Fields list and choose the `Orders` table.\n",
    "- Right-click and select **New column**.\n",
    "- In the formula bar, draft the DAX formula:\n",

    "\n",
    "In DAX, Aggregation Functions help summarize and analyze data by performing calculations on a group of specific data points, returning a single value. They include summation, counting, and returning average values, percentiles and min/max values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Aggregation Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SUM:** Computes the total of a column's values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```DAX\n",
    "  Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Revenue])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **AVERAGE:** Determines the mean value of a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```DAX\n",
    "  Average Revenue = AVERAGE(Sales[Revenue])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **COUNT:** Enumerates the number of rows containing data in a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```DAX\n",
    "  Order Count = COUNT(Orders[Order ID])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **MAX:** Identifies the highest value within a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```DAX\n",
    "  Maximum Sale = MAX(Sales[Revenue])\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "  ```DAX\n",
    "  Minimum Sale = MIN(Sales[Revenue])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extended Aggregation Functions: The “X” Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, while functions like `SUM` and `COUNT` operate directly on columns, their \"X\" counterparts, like `SUMX` and `COUNTX`, offer more versatility. They allow you to iterate over a table or a table expression and then perform aggregations.\n",
    "\n",
    "They have the general formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "```DAX\n",
    " X_FUNCTION(Table,expression)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SUMX:** Iterates over a table and sums up the result of an expression for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you have a sales database where each product sold might have a unique discount applied. While the `Sales` table lists each product's base price and the discount percentage, the final sale price after applying the discount isn't directly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Product Name | Base Price | Discount Percentage |\n",

    "| Headphones  | $100       | 2%                   |\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to create a measure to calculate the total revenue after applying the discounts to each product. Instead of creating a separate calculated column for the discounted price and then summing that column, you can use `SUMX` to iterate over the `Sales` table, calculate the discounted price for each product, and then sum these values together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DAX formula would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```DAX\n",
    "Total Discounted Sales = SUMX(Sales, Sales[Base Price] * (1 - Sales[Discount Percentage]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formula, for each row in the `Sales` table, `SUMX` calculates the price after discount and then aggregates (sums up) all these calculated values to give the total discounted sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **COUNTX:** Counts the number of rows in a table, dependent on the evaluation of an expression\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a product sales table and you're interested in identifying how many products have achieved sales above a certain threshold. Let's say you want to know how many products have sold more than 100 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Instead of creating a separate calculated column that flags products with sales over 100 units and then counting those flags, you can use `COUNTX` to iterate over the `Product Sales` table and directly count the products meeting the criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DAX formula would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```DAX\n",
    "Products Over 100 Sales = COUNTX(Product Sales, IF(Product Sales[Units Sold] > 100, 1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `COUNTX` iterates over each row in the `Product Sales` table. For each product with units sold over 100, the IF function returns 1. `COUNTX` then counts these 1's, giving the total number of products with significant sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences Between Standard and Extended Forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct vs. Iterative:** Standard aggregation functions like `SUM` and `AVERAGE` work directly on entire columns, but their extended counterparts iterate through rows, performing calculations based on expressions\n",
    "2. **Flexibility:** \"X\" functions like `SUMX` or `COUNTX` offer more complex aggregations, enabling custom operations on each row of a table before the aggregation\n",
    "3. **Performance Consideration:** Iterative functions, by nature, might be slower, especially with large datasets, because they evaluate the expression row-by-row\n"

    "## Filtering in Power BI\n",
    "\n",
    "In Power BI, **filtering** lets you focus on specific data segments. Instead of viewing every row of data, you can zoom in on specific subsets, like transactions in a specific month or sales of a single product. Filtering refines data based on defined conditions or criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter Context\n",
    "\n",
    "When you construct a report in Power BI, every visual works with DAX under the hood. When you craft or adjust a visual, it establishes a filter context. This context can be implicit, derived from the visual's construction, or explicit, from applying filter conditions manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter context is the environment in which a DAX formula is evaluated. When you introduce a measure to a report, its values adjust based on the context. For example, if you plot a measure like `Total Revenue` on a bar chart segmented by product category, the product category is an implicit or automatic filter context, which causes the measure to evaluate differently on each bar. However,you might add an additional filter to restrict the filter context of the entire visual to a specific year, so that only that year's data are displayed on the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every visual in Power BI has an underlying filter context influenced by several elements, from slicers to other visuals. As a result, a measure's value can shift based on its placement or interaction within a report.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `FILTER` function creates a new table that includes only the rows that satisfy a certain condition. You can use `FILTER` to reduce the number of rows in the table that you are working with, and use only specific data in calculations. `FILTER` is not used independently, but as a function that is embedded in other functions that require a table as an argument.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `CALCULATE` function evaluates an expression in a context modified by filters. It's syntax is `CALCULATE(<expression>,<filter1>,<filter2>,...)`. A good way to think about this is that when you see `CALCULATE`, you should think \"Ignore current filter context\". In effect, `CALCULATE` overrides whatever the current filter context is, and replaces it with the context specified by its own filter arguments.\n",

    "In above example, the `CALCULATE` function calculates the total SalesAmount for just the East Region, and assigns it to the measure `Revenue East`. This measure would always return the revenue for the East region, even if it was used in a visual with a different context. So for example, in a bar chart broken down by product category, it would apply the product category filter, but would only show values for the `EAST` region. But in a bar chart broken down by region, it would show the correct value for the `EAST` region, but all other regions would show a value of zero, as both the visual's region filter, and the filter inside the `CALCULATE` function would be applied.\n",

An example of where this is useful is in situations where you have multiple date fields in a table (eg. `[Order Date]` and `[Ship Date]`), connected to a single date table. Power BI can only have one active relationship between tables at a time, so if you have multiple relationships between the same pair of table, one will be active by default, but you can use the others in a measure with the `USERELATIONSHIP` function.\n",
