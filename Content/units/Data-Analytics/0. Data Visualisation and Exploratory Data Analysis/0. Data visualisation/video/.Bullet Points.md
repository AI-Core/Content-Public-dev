# EDA

- Before using data, it's important to explore it and understand it
    - We call this exploratory data analysis, or EDA


It's essential for a numer of reasons
    - Not everything can be known using aggregated statistics such as mean or variance
    - Without doing EDA you might not notice that lots of values are missing that your data is dirty in some other way
        - for example it might contain outliers or redundancies
        - you can catch these more easily by visualizing the data
    - EDA can also help you to get an idea for the relationships or patterns in your data
        - and often you might realise that a simple approach will achieve your goal, rather than going to something super advanced
            - if you visualise data which you want to cluster, you might see that they are already clearly grouped, in which case you can just write the equation of the line that splits them, and see whether they are above or below, rather than using a neural network

- The most basic way of doing this is by looking at the raw data
    - This can often help you get a good understanding of the data you are dealing with
        - What are the types of data included?
        - Are there many missing values?
        - And much more

- Beyond looking at raw data, you can visualise it
    - There are many ways to represent data, and each graph suits better certain situations
            - For example histograms are used if we want to see the frequency of a categorical variable
            - There are many libraries to represent bar graphs, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn... Show some examples in Python
            - Or the Sankey Diagram that can be used to see how many
