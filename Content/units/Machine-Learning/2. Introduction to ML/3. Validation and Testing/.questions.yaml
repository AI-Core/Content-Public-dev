questions:
  - question: Why do you need to split your data into training and testing?
    answer: Because otherwise, the model can see the whole dataset and we won't have more data samples to check if the model is generalizing well
  - question: What is the difference between testing and validation?
    answer: The testing set is a set that the model won't see until it finished training. On the other hand, the validation set allows us to check if the model we get is the best one generalizing 
  - question: Why would you want to use validation sets?
    answer: Validation sets are used to check that the model you obtained training is not the best model due to a matter of luck. Maybe the testing set turns out to be great for the hyperparameters you got, but then, another set is not as good. So the validation set gives a different perspective to the hyperparameters you obtained
  - question: Usually, how do you split the dataset into training, testing, and validation?
    answer: Usually, the data is split into training and testing, and then, the testing set is split into testing and validation. An alternative would be splitting the data into training and testing, and use cross validation with the training set
  - question: How do you split the data using sklearn? What parameters does the model accept?
  - question: You have 100 samples in X, and set `0.3` in test_size. How many samples will you have in the test set? And what if you write 1?
    answer: 0.3 will return 30 samples, 1 returns just 1 because it's an integer
  - question: Why would you want to set a random state in the method?
  - question: For other algorithms that use randomness, how can you set a seed for all of them?
  - question: Name two possible sources of Data Leakage
    answer: Same sample in both sets. Scaling the whole dataset before spliting 
  - question: Go to the sklearn API. Read information about the StratifiedkFold class. What is a strata?
