  - question: What is elastic net regression? What penalty does it implement?
    answer: the elastic net is a regularized regression method that linearly combines the L1 and L2 penalties
  - question: How is the impact of elastic net regression on the parameters different from lasso and ridge?
    answer: Elastic net doesn't zero out features, as opposed to lasso, and it doesn't penalize large errors as much as ridge
