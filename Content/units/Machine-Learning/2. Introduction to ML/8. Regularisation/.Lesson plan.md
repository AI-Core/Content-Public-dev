- [COMPREHENSION]
    - what is regularisation?
        - any technique that reduces generalisation error
    - describe how early stopping is a form or regularisation
    - what is an LP norm?
        - nothing necessarily to do with regularisation
        - show equation
    - what is a norm penalty?
        - adding any LP norm to a loss function
    - what new hyperparameter does a norm penalty introduce?
    - how does a norm penalty change the loss function?
        - describe how the optimiser trades off minimising the original unregularised loss function and the norm penalty
    - what is L1 regularisation?
        - what does L1 norm penalty look like on a graph?
        - how does it change the gradient of the loss function?
    - what is L2 regularisation?
        - what does L2 norm penalty look like on a graph?
        - how does it change the loss function?
        - how does it change the gradient of the loss function?
    - which regularisation technique can be used for feature selection?
        - L1
