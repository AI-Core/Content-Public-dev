# Multiclass classification

- Draw the diagram for multiclass classification

- [COMPREHENSION]
    - what's the difference between binary and multiclass classification?
        - what's the difference in the labels?
    - how does the shape of the inputs and outputs to our model change?
    - what is the softmax function?
        - how is it similar to the sigmoid function?
        - how is it different?
    - why is it called a softmax?
        - one value in the vector will be nearly one, all of the others will be nearly zero

## From binary to multiclass
- draw some datapoints in x1-x2 (feature) space with at least three different classes
- draw multiple linear boundaries each correctly separating one class from all of the others
