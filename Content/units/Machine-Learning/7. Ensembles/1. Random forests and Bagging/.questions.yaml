questions:
  - question: What is an ensemble method?
  - question: What condition do models have to meet in order to make the ensemble work?
    answer: They should not be correlated. Otherwise the ensemble will have basically the same output as the weak learner
  - question: What is the advantage of using a weak learner?
    answer: Weak learners are simple models, and as such, they reduce the variance of the model, preventing overfitting. 
  - question: What is bootstraping?
  - question: What is bagging? What is it short for?
  - question: "True or False. Bagging uses all the samples in the dataset"
  - question: Is random forest always a bagging method?
    answer: No, it can also be a pasting method. When sampling is performed without replacement, it is called pasting
  - question: What is the advantage of using random forest instead of a decision Tree?
  - question: Name three hyperparameters that you can set in a random forest
  - question: How do you visualize the most relevant features in a dataset using random forest? How does it work? 
    answer: feature_importances_. It looks at how much the tree nodes that use that feature reduce impurity on average
