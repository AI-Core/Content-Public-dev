- show the distributions and ask which is better
    - the ones which would make seeing the data more likely are better

- i.i.d data
    - each example is iid

- math recap
    - product rule of probability
        - independent probabilities multiplied together
    - sum of logs = log of products


- draw 2-D probability graph of heights
- they follow some distribution that nature created
    - we call this the data generating distribution
- our aim is to build a model that represents this same data generating distribution

- why doesnt our pdf have to integrate to one?
    - not sure
    - not a constraint that we put on our logistic regression model


- draw some data points on a 1-d feature space
    - draw a vertical probability axis
