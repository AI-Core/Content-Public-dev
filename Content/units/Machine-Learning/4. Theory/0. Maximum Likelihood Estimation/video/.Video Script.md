# Maximum Likelihood Estimation

- The data that you use is very unlikely to represent the same distribution as the whole population.
    - The distribution in our dataset is empirical, meaning that its distribution corresponds to what we can observe
    - Unfortunately, it is very unlikely that it contains samples from all the range of possible values
    - But we want our distribution to be as representative as possible
    - However it is complicated to be sure that a distribution is representative
    - But we can have a good intuition about it if we have some domain knowledge (or we research about it)
    - The same way we have a distribution for our dataset, we also have a distribution for our predictions
    - And ideally, the predictions should be as close as possible to the real distribution

- With this in mind, we can infer that we want the distribution of our predictions to be as close to the distribution of the real data
    - We can assume that the data we have to be representative of the whole population
    - Therefore, if we approximate the distribution of our predictions with the empirical distribution, we can assume that we have a good approximation
    - We can use Maximum Likelihood Estimation to obtain the parameters that make the prediction distribution to be as likely as the observed data

        - So, following that definition, we need to get the parameters that make the predictions fall under the empirical distribution
        - __`[SECOND LINE]`__ The probability of the whole dataset is the multiplication of the probabilities of each sample 
        - __`[THIRD LINE]`__ Since the logarithm of the probabilities is monotonically increasing, we can use the logarithm of the probabilities to get the maximum likelihood
        - __`[FOURTH LINE]`__ And the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms 
        - __`[FIFTH LINE]`__ So far we are maximizing the likelihood, but we can also minimize it if we add a negative sign
        - __`[SIXTH LINE]`__ And the average value of some function f under a probability distribution p is the expectation E(f). So in this case we have the expectation of the minimum average negative log likelihood
    - Maximum likelihood estimation can help us derive metrics such as cross entropy or mean squared error

- Let's see how to derive cross entropy, but first, what is entropy?
    - First of all, this concept of entropy is related to information theory and not to thermodynamics
    - Let's assume that we have a discrete variable _x_, which has a probability distribution _p_.
    - The amount of information can be seen as a "degree of surprise" on learning the value of _x_
    - So, if we observe the value of _x_ at some point, and we see that the value we observe is the one that has the highest probability, that is not giving us much information, since we know that the probability of the value we observe is the highest
    - But if we observe _x_ and we see that the probability of the value is very unlikely, we are receiving more information
    - We can infer that the amount of information is a function of the probability of the value
    - Let's define it as _h_ as the information gain, that, if we have two unrelated events _x_ and _y_, it will become the addition of both h(x) and h(y)
    - And since the probability of two unrelated events is the product of the two events
    - We can derive that the information gain is given by the logarithm of the probability of _x_ h(x) = -log(p(x))
    - The negative sign ensures that information gain is positive or zero
    - And the base of the logarithm is arbitrary, but it is usually 2
    - Now, assume that someone wants to transmit the value of _x_ to someone else
    - The average amount of information in the process is obtained by taking the expectation of the information gain with respect to the distribution p(x):
    $$
    H(X) = - \sum_{i=1}^n p(x)log(p(x))
    $$
    - This value is called entropy or Shannon Entropy
    - You can rewrite the formula as:
    $$
    H(X) = - E_{x~p}[log(p(x))]
    $$
    - To put this in perspective, let's say that we have a variable _x_ with 8 possible states, and each state has the same probability of being chosen
    - If we choose the base of the logarithm to be 2, it seems reasonable to assume that we can communicate the value of _x_ using 3 bits:
    $$
    H(X) = -8 * \frac{1}{8} log_2 \frac 1 8 = 3 bits
    $$
    - However, if the distribution is not uniform, the amount of information will be different
    - For example, if we have a variable _x_ with 8 possible states, and the probability of each state is 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/64, 1/64, 1/64, 1/64, the entropy will be:
    $$
    H(X) = -\frac{ 1 }{2} log_2 \frac{ 1}{ 2} -\frac{ 1}{ 4} log_2 \frac{ 1}{ 4} -\frac 1 8 log_2 \frac 1 8 -\frac{ 1}{ 16} log_2 \frac{ 1 }{16} -\frac{ 4 }{64} log_2 \frac {1} {64}= 2 \ bits
    $$
    - So the nonuniform distribution has a smaller entropy that the uniform distribution
    - This means that we need to provide less information to transmit the value of _x_ for the nonuniform distribution
    - In other words, distribution that are nearly deterministic have a smaller entropy than distributions that are not deterministic

- However, from the maximum likelihood estimation, we wanted to check how similar two distributions are
    - Suppose we have an unknown distribution _p_ that we have modelled using an approximate distribution _q_
    - The average additional information we need to provide to _q_ to approximate it to _p_ is given by:
    $$
    KL(p||q) = E_{x~p}[\log{p(x)} - \log{q(x)}]
    $$
    - This is known as the Kullback-Leibler divergence
    - It measures the difference between the probability distributions, which is what we wanted to obtain from the maximum likelihood estimation
    - Notice that the value of the entropy is present in the Kullback-Leibler divergence as:
    $$
    H(p) = - E_{x~p}[\log{p(x)}]
    $$
    - The remaining term in the formula is the cross entropy of q relative to _p_
    $$
    - E_{x~p}[\log{q(x)}]
    $$
    - So, the equation can be rewritten as:
    $$
    E_{x~p}[\log{q(x)}] = KL(p||q) + H(p)
    $$
    - So, by minimizing the cross entropy, implicitly we are minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
    - So, in other words, if we minimize the cross entropy, we are minimizing the distances between the predicted and the empirical distribution

- What we just saw was applicable for classification problems. What would happend if the algorithm were to predict the value of a continuous variable?
    - To explain this, we need to talk very briefly about the Gaussian distribution
    - The Gaussian distribution is a continuous probability distribution. 
    - This distribution is a normal distribution centered around the mean and with a standard deviation
    - <p align=center><img src=.images/gaussian.png width=1000></p>
    - We can assume that the distribution of a prediction is a Gaussian distribution because of the central limit theorem
    - So, what does this mean?
    - __`[RUN A DEMO] The demo shows a simple regression and each label will have a Gaussian distribution`__
    -  We have an initial dataset with a continuous variable _x_ and a label _y_
    - __`[RUN THE CELL THAT PLOTS THE DATA AS IT IS] plt.scatter(X, Y)`__
    - We can see in this plot the dataset, and each label depends on the value of the variable X
    - __`[RUN THE NEXT CELL]`__
    - The central limit theorem states that each label has a Gaussian distribution
    - So, as we can see here, each label presents, apart from the label itself, a Gaussian distribution
    - __`[RUN THE NEXT CELL]`__
    - So, if we train a model and make predictions with it, the predictions will also have a Gaussian distribution
    - We can use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the parameters that make both the prediction and the label Gaussian distributions to be as likely as possible

    - __`[THIRD LINE]`__ So, going back to the maximum likelihood estimation formula, the distribution we are using now is the Gaussian distribution
    - __`[FOURTH LINE]`__ Since we are looking for the minimum, we can get rid of the constant terms
    - __`[FIFTH LINE]`__ And since the logarithm of the exponential of x is x, we end up with the next formula
    - Does it look familiar? Yes, it is the mean squared error!
