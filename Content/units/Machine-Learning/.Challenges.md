# Challenges

## Prelude

### SVD
- compare SVD on an image with SVD on a matrix with rows and columns

## Module 0: Machine Learning Concepts

### 1. Linear Regression

- implement grid search rather than random search
- turn the code that we wrote in this session into a Python module
- put grid search into a file

### 2. Gradient Based Optimisation

- implement gradient descent with Nesterov momentum
- train the same linear regression model whilst decreasing the learning rate over epochs

## Module 1: Classification and regression

### 3. Regularisation basics

- implement early stopping whilst training a model

### 4. Maximum Likelihood Estimation

- find the MLE parameter for the variance in the same way that we found the MLE parameter for the mean of our Gaussian of our unsupervised
