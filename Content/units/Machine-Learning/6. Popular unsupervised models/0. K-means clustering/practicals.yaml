    1. Create a new folder and download [this](https://aicore-files.s3.amazonaws.com/Data-Science/data_utils/utils.py) file into it.
    2. Create a new python file and import the `get_classification_data` method from utils. 
    3. Generate some randomised cartoon data with `get_classification_data`. Make 5 clusters and 2 features. Leave the mean at 100, and play around with the standard deviation until you have a small amount of overlap between some of the clusters. 
    4. Create a KMeans model object with the same number of clusters.
    5. Fit the model to the preprocessed data using the fit method.
    6. Predict the cluster of each datapoint in your dataset.
    7. Visualise your results by plotting the data points and color-coding them based on their cluster assignments.
