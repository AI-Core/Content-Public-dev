# Git and Github

## Script

- **`[START SCENE] webcam in full screen`**
- Most likely, you found yourself in a situation where you were working on a big project, and you made many copies of the same file
  - That way, you wouldn't lose any information in case the new version of the file was not convincing
  - And you end up with files like: "Final.pdf", "Final_1.pdf", "Final_this_one_for_sure.pdf".
- To solve these problems, Version Control Systems, or VCS for short, appeared.
- VSCs are systems that record changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later
- So imagine your team is working on your code, and you are adding features

  - At some point, you realize that the features you added are not working, and you would like to revert to a previous version of the code
  - VCSs allow you to revert selected files to a previous state
  - Revert the entire project to a previous state
  - Compare changes over time
  - See who last modified something that might be causing a problem
  - And many more things!

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] Open Keynote "Git_Github.key"`**
  - You can find mainly three different types of VCS:
    - Local
    - Centralized
    - Distributed
  - Local VCSs keep track of a file or set of files in a local machine, so it is not very useful if you are collaborating with a team

<br>

- **`[NEXT SLIDE] Central VCS`**
  - Centralized VCSs keep track of the files in a central system where many computers have access.
    - The problem with this distribution is that all computers rely on a single machine
    - If the hard disk the central database is on becomes corrupted, you lose absolutely everything

<br>

- **`[NEXT SLIDE] Distributed VCS`**
  - So, finally, we have Distributed VCSs, where the files are mirrored from a central system.
    - So, if any server dies, any of the clients can copy any file back up to the server to restore it
  - `Git` is a Distributed VCSs, and it is one of the most common tools for code collaboration right now

<br>

- **`[NEXT SLIDE] Git`**
  - `Git` keeps track of the changes the user makes to the files in the directory
  - Instead of keeping a version of each file, `git` creates versions of a file in that directory
  - Each version in this picture is named commit, and when the file or files are committed, that information goes to the `git` repository
  - You can think of commits as a picture of your files at a certain point in time
    - So, if you accidentally made a mistake on one of your commits, you can always revert back to one of the previous commits
    - because `git` has that information thanks to the "picture" it took.
  - It is important to know that `git` compares the previous commit with the current state and adds the changes, keeping the commits as lightweight as possible
  - Those changes don't necessarily correspond to new information
    - You can also delete information from a version, and `git` will make "add" that deletion as new information
    - So you will never lose information
  - Each commit has an identifier in the form of a 40-character string.
    - This will help us when we want to go back to one of the specific commits we have in the repository

<br>

- **`[NEXT SLIDE] Git states`**
  - But, how does `git` know when our files are ready to be committed?
  - `Git` has three states for the files in a repository: "Modified", "Staged", "Committed".
  - Let's assume we start here **`[point to the first line]`**, from a committed file. This can also be a set of files.
    - When we modify the file, `git` notices that the file has changed from the state it had in the repository
    - This file changes, but it is not in the repository yet
  - When we are happy with the changes, we can stage those changes **`[point to the second line]`**, and the file is marked as ready to be committed
  - Finally, we move the staged files to the repository by committing them **`[point to the third line]`**

<br>

- **`[NEXT SLIDE] Git branches (first)`**
  - One of the more powerful tools in git are branches
  - Branches allow us to work on different commits in parallel
  - A branch is nothing more than a pointer to a previous commit we made
    - and from that pointer, we will create new parallel commits
  - By the way, the convention for representing consecutive commits is like this, with the new commit pointing to the previous one
  - So, to explain branches, take a look at the pointer named "main", which is the name of the branch you have by default
  - On top of "main", we can see a tag saying "HEAD".
    - "HEAD" represents the current branch in which we are working
  - For simplicity reasons, we are going to give a single number to each commit
    - But in reality, as mentioned, each commit has an identifier with 40 characters

<br>

- **`[NEXT SLIDE] Git branches (second)`**
  - We can add more branches to this commit; let's say, for example, that we create a new branch called "features".
  - And we can move to that branch, so "HEAD" is now in the "features" branch

<br>

- **`[NEXT SLIDE] Git branches (third)`**
  - If we start adding commits to this branch, "features" will present new commits
  - while "main" will still point to the same commit
  - We can add as many commits we want to "features", the "main" branch will stay there unless we move to that branch

<br>

- **`[NEXT SLIDE] Git branches (fourth)`**
  - So, if we move to "main" and start adding commits, we can see that a parallel job appears
  - Both branches are now different, and they will have their changes compared to "commit 3".

<br>

- **`[NEXT SLIDE] Git merge`**
  - When we are ready to apply the changes in one branch to another, we are ready to "merge" both branches
  - By default, the "main" branch will accept the changes made in other branches
    - So, in this case, we are applying the changes made in "features" to "main".
  - At that point, "features" can be removed
  - And any change we made in that branch will be reflected in the "main" branch

<br>

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] Desktop Disposition`**
  - Alright, so now that we know the theory, how do we apply it?
  - First of all, you can use git from your Terminal if you are on Mac or Linux, or gitbash if you are on Windows
  - In my case, I am using my Mac so that I will open my Terminal
  - And we can see on my Desktop that there is a folder named "AiCore_Test".
  - So, in the Terminal, I am going to change the directory to that folder
    - **`[Type cd Desktop/Ai and press TAB]`** Remember that you don't have to type the whole directory
    - You can press TAB, and the Terminal will autocomplete the name of the file or directory
  - We can see that there is nothing inside **`[RUN ls]`**
  - I am going to create a repository in this working directory by running `git init` **`[RUN git init]`**
  - And we can see that we still have nothing **`[RUN ls]`**
  - But, if we list ALL the files, including the hidden ones **`[RUN ls -a]`**
    - We can see that there is a hidden directory named `.git`.
    - This is the repository storing the information of the snapshots we will take
  - Alright, so let's say that I have created some files
    - **`[RUN touch example.py]`**
    - **`[RUN echo "hello world" > hello.txt]`**
    - **`[RUN ls]`**
  - We have a couple of MODIFIED files
    - git knows it because it compares the last commit with the current directory state
  - How do we check the state of our files? Simple, we can run `git status` **`[RUN git status]`**
    - And we can see that two files are modified, the ones we have just created
    - These files are in the modified state as we discussed earlier
  - So we are happy with the files we created, and we want to stage them
    - We can stage a whole directory typing `git add .` **`[TYPE git add .]`**
    - Or we can stage a single file typing `git add` and the name of the file **`[TYPE git add example.py]`**
    - Let's stage all the files for now **`[RUN git add .]`**
  - And if we look at `git status` again **`[RUN git status]`**
    - We can see that the message has changed
    - And that our two files have been moved to the stage state
  - The last step is to commit the staged files
    - When you make a commit, you need to provide information about the changes you made from the previous commit
    - This information comes in the form of a message that we include in the commit command
    - In this case, it is our first commit, so we can simply set it as "first commit".
    - But for any other commit, you should try to be as concise as possible.
    - So, when you make a commit, you will commit ALL the files that are in the staged state
    - And to do so, you run `git commit` followed by the -m flag that stands for "message", and followed by the message
    - So it will look like this **`[RUN git commit -m "first commit"]`**
  - A message confirming the commit appears
  - And now, `git status` says that we are up to date
  - Great! Now we know the basic use of git. What about branches?
  - You can create a new branch from the last commit running `git checkout` followed by the -b flag that stands for branch and the name of the branch you want to create
    - So, following the previous example, let's create a new branch called "features".
    - You can do it by typing `git checkout -b features` **`[RUN git checkout -b features]`**
  - You have created and switched to a new branch now
  - To check the active branches in your repository, you can type `git branch`.
    - It will return a list of the branches, and the asterisk represents HEAD
    - So, in this case, we can see an asterisk next to "features", indicating we are working in that branch now
  - Let's add a new file to "features" **`[RUN touch example_2.py]`**
    - Stage it **`[RUN git add example_2.py]`**
    - And commit it, don't forget about the message! **`[RUN git commit -m "Create a second example"]`**
  - Good, everything seems to be working fine. We have three files in this directory **`[RUN ls]`**
  - But, if you remember from the slides, "main" shouldn't have any of the new changes reflected.
    - Let's check that out by switching to that branch
    - **`[RUN git checkout main]`**
  - And observe the files we have now in this branch **`[RUN ls]`**
  - We are back to having only two files!
  - As mentioned, the changes are only reflected in the branch named "features".
    - If we want to apply these changes to the "main" branch, we have to merge "features" into "main".
  - Now that we are in "main", we can simply say, "Alright, merge here the changes from features".
  - To do that, we can run `git merge features` **`[RUN git merge features]`**
  - And if we observe the files now in "main", we can see that `example_2.py` is here now!

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] Open Safari`**
  - So, one of the first things we mentioned about git is that it is distributed
  - That means that the repository and all the changes are backed up by many computers and a central system
  - How do we communicate with each other to share these files?
    - One of the more popular solutions is GitHub **`[Go to github]`**
  - Github allows us to host and manage our repositories online
    - That way, any member of our team can access the files in the repo
  - If you haven't, you can create an account by clicking 'Sign up' on the top right
  - But if you already have an account, log in with your credential **`[Sign in using your credentials]`**
  - We are going to see how to create a remote repository and connect it with our local machine
  - So, on this page, simply click on 'New'. **`[I just added the picture just in case we are on a different page]`** <p align=center><img src=.images/git.png width=300></p>
  - And then, let's create a test repo. **`[Name it AiCore-Test for example]`**
    - It is a good practice to include a README file to give information to other users about our project
    - So let's tick that box
    - And click on create
    - And that's it! The repo has been created
  - Now, how do we use this repository locally?
  - You can take a look at this green button that says 'Code' and copy the URL of the repository **`[COPY THE URL]`**
  - And now you can clone this repository in your local machine

<br>

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] Desktop Disposition`**
  - So, in the Terminal, first, you should go to the directory where you want to clone your repository
  - We were in the AiCore_Test directory we created earlier. Let's move back to Desktop **`[RUN cd ..]`**
  - And now, we can clone our repository in a folder created in Desktop by running `git clone` followed by the URL we copied **`[TYPE git clone <URL>]`**. By default, it will create a directory with the same name as the repository we created.
    - But we already have a folder with a very similar name
    - You can change the name of the destination directory by adding a name after the URL.
    - So the command would become `git clone` followed by the URL, followed by the name we want to give to the new directory
    - Let's just call it "AiCore-Remote" **`[TO THE PREVIOUS COMMAND ADD AiCore-Remote]`**
    - Now that it's cloned, we can see inside **`[RUN cd AiCore-Remote]`**, that there is a README file, the same we had when creating the repo on GitHub
  - Committing files to this repository works the same
    - Create a new file **`[RUN touch example.py]`**
    - Stage the file **`[RUN git add .]`**
    - And commit the staged files **`[RUN git commit -m "Add an example"]`**
  - But now, the new commits are only reflected locally
  - To show this on the GitHub repository, we need to push the changes
  - Push is a git command that will upload the changes to the remote repository
  - To use it, you can run `git push`.
  - And the committed files will be uploaded to the corresponding remote repository

<br>

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] Open Safari`**
  - Let's go back to GitHub to check if the files were correctly pushed
  - After refreshing...
  - Yeah! We can see that our example.py is there!
  - What if we want to push an existing local repository to GitHub
  - Let's see how to do it
  - **`[Go to the Home page]`** Let's create a new repository
  - And name it AiCore-Test2
  - But in this case, we are not adding any additional files, so don't tick any of the README or .gitgnore boxes
  - **`[CLICK on Create]`**
  - After you create the repository, GitHub will show you all the steps you have to take to push your existing repositories
  - So, let's try these steps with the local repository we created earlier
  - We can simply copy and paste the instructions GitHub provides.
  - Let's explain each step to see what it means
    - The first step says `git remote add origin` followed by the URL of our repository
      - This means that we are going to add a new remote connection to our local repository
      - In this case, we are adding a connection that we will name "origin".
      - And whose value is the URL of our repository
      - By default, the value we give to the URL is "origin", but you can give the name you want as long as you are consistent with the names in all the commands in which you have to use this URL
    - The second step is `git branch -M main`.
      - This is renaming our current branch to "main".
      - This is just in case you are using "master" as the default branch, so there are no conflicts between your local repository and the remote repository
    - The last step is pushing the commits to the remote repository by running `git push -u origin main`.
      - The -u in this command indicates upstream
      - This means that our changes are pushed to an upstream URL called "origin".
      - And origin is the name we gave to the URL of our repository
      - So, overall, we are pushing the changes in the "main" branch from our local repository to the URL corresponding to "origin".
  - Let's see this in action

<br>

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] Desktop Disposition`**
  - **`[Open Terminal]`** So, let's change directories to AiCore_Test.
    - First, we move back to Desktop **`[RUN cd ..]`**
  - And then we move inside AiCore_Test **`[RUN cd AiCore_Test]`**
  - We already committed our files in this directory, so there is no need for making another commit
  - We can now run the steps mentioned earlier
  - The first one is `git remote add origin` followed by the URL **`[RUN git remote add origin https://github.com/life-efficient/AiCore-Test2.git]`**
  - The second one consists of renaming our branch. **`[RUN git branch -M main]`**
  - And finally, we upload the changes to the upstream remote named origin **`[RUN git push -u origin main]`**
  - Our Terminal should show a message saying that the upload was successful
  - Let's check that out on GitHub

<br>

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] Open Safari`**
  - Let's take a look at our GitHub repo **`[Open AiCore-Test2]`**
  - And as we can see, the three files we created earlier locally are now in our GitHub repository!
  - Great, we are ready to work with both git and Github

<br>

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] webcam in full screen`**
  - As you can see, git is a powerful tool that helps us keep track of our files by making snapshots of our working directory
  - We can use this feature to go back in time to a previous version (or a commit) in case we need to retrieve information from the past
  - In addition, git allows us to contribute with our teammates easily
  - You and your team can have a central repository named GitHub, in which you store all the information stored in your repository
  - With that in mind, you can
