# 3. Class Decorators

- Classmethods
    - Classmethods are used to create a method that is called from the class rather than from an instance.
    - _If they have already seen pandas, show them some methods that are called from pd.DataFrame_
    - Class methods are useful if you know that the instance you are going to create will have a specific set of attributes.
    - They are also useful if you want to create an instance from a different data type that you set in the constructor

- Static methods
    - Static methods are used to create a method that can be called from a class or an instance, but they are not tied to any instance.
    - They can be used as regular functions.
    - We use them as a way of encapsulation

-Property Decorators
    - Property decorators are used to create a property that can keep a value private.
    - They make the attributes private, and you can specify a setter, setter and deleter for the attribute.

- Dataclass
    - Dataclasses offer a convenient way to create a class
    - They add, by default, an `__init__`, a __repr__ method that returns a string representation of the class, and an `__eq__` method that checks if two instances are equal.
