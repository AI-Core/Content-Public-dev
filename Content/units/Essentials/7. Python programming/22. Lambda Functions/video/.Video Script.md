<!-- MOTIVATION -->

<!-- CONVERT UPPERCASING FUNCTION TO LAMBDA FUNCTION -->

_show assigning `uppercase =` lambda function_

- the right hand side of the colon must always be an expression

- this makes a short function even shorter and tidies up our code a little

- the case where they can be even tidier is when a function is only needed once
- in that case, there's no point assigning it to a function name

<!-- ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS -->

- Additionally, lambda functions don't need a name, that is why they are also called anonymous functions

<!-- USE LAMBDA IN FILTER FUNCTION -->

<!-- SHOW THAT YOU CAN CALL ANONYMOUSLY BY WRAPPING IN BRACKETS -->
