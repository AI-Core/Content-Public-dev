- **`[START SCENE] webcam in full screen`**
  - Let's talk about one of the main concepts of Python Programming:
    - Object Oriented Programming, or OOP for short
  - What does that mean? The key word there is "object"
  - Forget about the code for a second and think about the world around you
  - _Everything_ is an object
    - this pencil is an object, this book is an object, this laptop is an object
    - each of them have different properties, like their color or weight
    - and each of them can do different things
      - the pencil can write and draw
    - "object" is just the most general word you can use to describe something which has properties and things it can do
  - Now switch back to Python
  - every data type you have seen so far also has properties and things it can do
    - for example, lists have properties like their length or values they contain
    - and they can do different things like add a new value
  - that means that they can be called objects
  - in fact, every data type you have seen so far is an object, lists are objects, dictionaries are objects, integers are objects...
  - importantly in programming, we call an object's properties "attributes", and we call the things they can do "methods"
  - in the python source code, the attributes and methods of each builtin data type are defined for all of the builtin data types
  - We can also define new kinds of objects with their own attributes and methods by creating what are called "classes"

<br>
- classes are templates for objects, which we can create many different instances of
- and each of those instances will be an object which has the methods and attributes we defined in the class
- python allows you to do that using the following syntax

- **`[FIRST CELL] First attempt - missing self`**

  - The first keyword is `class`, we use this keyword to tell Python that we are about to define a class
  - Then, we give a name to the class. There are two main conventions for class names:
    - Importantly, they are written using PascalCase, that is all together with each word capitalized
    - The other thing is that the name should be a name of what this new datatype will represent. For example Dog, Cat, Cycle... Something that can perform actions
  - Optionally, we can put parentheses on the end, but it is not necessary
  - Inside the class, we define the methods. A method is a function inside a class, so that means:
    - All methods are functions, but not all functions all methods
  - these methods are the things that the instance of the class can do
  - they are functions attached to this particular data type we are defining
  - We'll talk about attributes shortly
  - once we've defined a class, we can create instances of it by assigning a variable to a call **`[highlight parentheses]`** of the class
  - in fact, another way to describe a class is as a blueprint for an object of a particular data type
  - here we've created two instances of the class.
  - like all variables in python, they are both objects with attributes and methods
  - then we can access it's methods by using the dot operator **`[highlight calling method_1 on next line]`**

  - let's try and run this code
  - **`[RUN CELL]`**
  - we get an error which tells us that the function takes no arguments, but that one argument was given
  - So what's happening here?

- **`[TALKING TO CAMERA] GAME class`**

  - Let's imagine that we have a class that represents a player of a game
  - We would have different instances of this class that represent different players
  - Each player might be on a different level, and behave differently as a result
  - So in the class, where the code defining this behaviour is defined python needs a way to tell which instance of the class is being referred to
  - under the hood, any time a method is called, Python passes in a variable which represents that instance as the first argument

- **`[NEXT CELL] first class with self used correctly`**

  - this is the variable that was passed into our method when we got the error
  - **`[POINT AT ERROR]`**
  - to fix it, we must define the variable which python passes the method in the method's definition
  - by convention, we call this variable `self`
  - **`[POINT AT self]`**
  - Understanding this argument is absolutely key to understanding classes and objects
  - `self` is a variable that represents "this instance of the class"
    - let me say that again
    - `self` is a variable that represents
    - wherever you see `self` you should say "this instance of the class"
  - that means that here, we would say that we are passing "this instance of the class" in as the first argument, called self
  - **`[POINT AT method definition]`**

- **`[NEXT CELL] GAME class`**

  - in this next cell I'm showing the more practical example where my class is a template for creating players of a game
  - i have just one method defined and as required, it takes in self as the first argument

- note that if you print the type of the instance, it will show the name of the class you defined. And this is my point that making classes is a way to define your own data types in python

- **`[NEXT CELL] ARGUMENTS to methods`**

  - note that you can pass arguments to methods following the self, and they are used in the same way
  - just remember that self is always passed in as the first positional argument
  - So, when you call any method of an instance, you need to pass one argument less than what the method is defined as taking in, because behind the scenes, python will pass in self for you

- **`[NEXT CELL] attributes`**

  - so we've seen methods, which are the things an instance of a class can do
  - now we're ready to see how we can use attributes, which are properties of the instance
  - if I'm inside the class, then I can assign an attribute to the instance by assigning it to self.attribute name
  - everyone struggles with how to read this line, so let me make it very clear
  - as i said earlier, when you see self, just say "this instance of the class"
  - so if i were to read this line i would say "assign this instances name attribute equal to harry"
  - if I am outside the class, then I can assign an attribute to the instance by name
  - in the same way as for methods, we can access and assign attributes through the dot operator

- boilerplate
  - Usually, instances require some code to run to be initialised
  - for example, in this case we had to define our player name
  - you cant have a player without a name
  - one way we could do this is by defining a method which sets everything up, and then calling it immediately after we create the instance
- **`[RUN NEXT CELL] method called immediately after initialising`**

  - but it seems redundant having to run both of these lines every time we want to create a new instance of a class because they are always going to appear immediately after one another
  - we call this kind of code which always needs to be there "boilerplate" code.
  - ideally there is never any boilerplate code
  - and here python has us covered
  - all classes already have some methods defined under the hood, even if we dont define them ourselves

- **`[RUN NEXT CELL] define init`**

  - one of them is called double underscore init double underscore
  - or init for short
  - the init is short for initialise, and that's because this method is run every time we initialise a new instance
  - the init method is also known as the initialiser or the constructor
  - by default the init method doesnt do anything, but we can overwrite it, which is what we are doing here
  - in here, I'll put all of the things we want to do when the instance is created
  - now if i run it, you can see that the code inside the initialiser has run

- **`[WEBCAM]`**

  - so what's with that weird name with the double underscores either side?
  - the double underscores on either side of the name indicate that this method is what is called a "magic method"
  - magic methods are never called directly, but instead define the behaviour for some particular python syntax
  - in the case of the init method, it defined the behaviour for putting parentheses after a class
  - which is why when i initialise a class, it runs the code in the init method
  - each magic method behaves differently, but the init method is passed arguments that were the sames ones passed into the parentheses when the instance was initialised

  - let's look at some other magic methods to get a better idea of things

- **`[next cell] more magic methods`**

  - so in this new version of the class I've shown 2 new magic methods which python recognises
  - you can tell they're magic methods because of the double underscores on either side of the name
  - one magic method I've defined here is the repr method. it defines the behaviour when an instance of this class is printed
  - another one I've defined here is the GT method. it defines the behaviour for comparing two things with a greater than sign
  - **`[RUN CELL]`**
  - so you can see both of those methods being used when I run the operations below
  - there are magic methods that define the behaviour for all operators and many builtin functions like len
  - if you have an idea of how you might want to use any of them, just look them up

- **`[GOOGLE] "python magic methods" and show list`**

  - look at example for len method in official docs

    <br>

- **`[INHERITANCE]`**

  - If i have similar classes which share some but not all of the same methods then I can use a concept called Inheritance
  - Inheritance lets different classes inherit shared attributes or methods from another class

<br>

- Let's create another class to explain this concept: Computer

- **`[NEXT CELL] Creating computer class`**
  - A computer might have these attributes:
    - Weight
    - RAM
    - GPU to indicate if the computer has a decent GPU
  - And some things a computer can do are:
    - Work
    - Code
    - Browse_internet
  - We can create a computer instance by calling
    that class and passing arguments to it
  - However, what if we want to define a gaming computer?
    - In a gaming computer, apart from everything we can do in a regular computer, we can play games with an enhanced GPU
    - So, creating a new class and adding everything again to the new class is gonna cause us to have to repeat ourselves, which we don't want to have to do
  - Another example would be defining a laptop
    - We can basically do the same
    - But laptops can be carried
    - Creating a new class to add a single method is quite repetitive
  - In these cases, we should use Inheritance
  - When one class inherits from another, instances of it will have access to all of the attributes and methods of the class which it is inheriting from
  - we call the class which it is inheriting from, the parent or base class
  - And the class that inherits is named child
  - so how do we do that in code?

<br>

- **`[NEXT CELL] Creating Laptop computer class`**
  - this is where the parentheses after the class name are required in it's definition
  - We need to put the base class in parentheses when defining the child class
  - That is equivalent to copy pasting the body of the base class into the child class
  - But now we are able to add more things methods to it
  - For example, let's create the method to carry a laptop: get_carried
  - When we create an instance of Laptop, we still pass the same arguments as if we were creating a computer
  - We can also use methods that are not explicitely defined in laptop, such as work and code, because they've been inherited
  - And, on top of that, we can use the new defined method: get carried

<br>

- **`[NEXT CELL] Creating a new Laptop class`**
  - With inheritance, apart from define new methods we can replace existing methods
  - For example, let's imagine that our laptop doesn't have connection because we are outside
  - Then, the browse method can be different
  - So, if we re-define the browse method, Laptop will get the behaviour of the last browse method

<br>

- **`[NEXT CELL] Creating a GamingComputer class`**

  - In some cases, we might need to call a method in the base class inside the child class
  - We can do that by using the super() method, which returns an object with all of the attributes and methods from the base class accessible through the dot operator
  - Once common use is calling the init method from the base class to re-define the init method in the child
  - In this case, we are creating a GamingComputer class
  - Let's assume that all Gaming computers have an enhanced GPU
  - And we are creating a new method named play_game
  - It might be repetitive to pass GPU equals to True, every time we create an instance of a gaming computer
  - So, inside the class we can leave that as an attribute that will always be passed to the parent as True
  - Thus, in the init method of GamingComputer we are calling for the init method in the base class
    - and we pass the same attributes we pass to GamingComputer plus a True corresponding to the GPU
  - So we create an instance of GamingComputer named `alienware` and we only pass the weight and the RAM
  - And if we try to print out whether the GPU is enhanced, it will return True

- Great, so now we know how inheritance works
- But, is it possible to have a class inheriting from more than one class?
- Yes! It is called multiple inheritance
- in practice it's not something I need to use often
- but Let's see a quick example of how it works

- **`[NEXT CELL] Creating a GamingLaptop class`**

  - We are creating a new class named GamingLaptop
  - which, as the name suggests, it is a combination of the GamingComputer class and the Laptop class
  - So, we can simply pass both classes when we define the class
  - And that will do it!
  - You can see that we are not adding anything new to the class, it will simply take the same methods from their parents
  - And when we define a new instance `asus`, it will be able to:
    - code
    - play games
    - and being carried
  - which are methods that were from both parents

## Summary

- Classes are a key concept in Python
- So it is important that you understand and apply them properly
- Today we have seen
  - Objects are variables which have attributes and methods
  - attributes are properties of the object
  - methods are things the object can do
  - Classes are templates for objects
  - we can create many instances of any class, and it will have those attributes and methods, which we can access throught the dot operator
  - when we call any method of an instance a class, python passes in this instance of the class as the first argument, which we can use to access its properties and methods within the method definition
  - we also saw that magic methods define the behaviour for some particular python sytax
  - classes can also inherit from one another
    - that allows us to tell Python how to behave when it applies its builtin functions and operations to our custom classes
  - Inheritance helps avoid repetition and better structure your code
  - And you can also make a class inherit from multiple classes through multiple inheritance
