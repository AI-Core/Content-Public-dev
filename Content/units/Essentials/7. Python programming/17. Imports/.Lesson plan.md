- [WATCH] Python imports
    - 3rd party imports
        - we often want to leverage the work of others and use their code
        - [SHOW] PYPI
            - people can publish python libraries to [PyPi](https://pypi.org) (the python package index)
        - and this is where our package manager, conda or pip, installs them from
        - this is how we make an import of a package we've installed
            - [DEMO] using conda: conda install pandas
            - [DEMO] using pip: pip install pandas
        - all that does is literally download the code from the internet, and put it in a place which is on our Python PATH, that is, a place on our computer where python looks for libraries when you import them
        - so how can you import files in python
    - local imports
        - sys is a library for accessing functions and parameters specific to your system
        - we can also import our own code from other places on our machine
        - [DEMO] import neighbouring file as module
            - `import neighbour`
            - that import is an object, and the variables defined inside are it's attributes
            - we can access them using the dot operator as usual
        - we can also use the `from` to import something from within a module 
        - the code we want might be a few folders deep, so we can use the . syntax to separate subfolders in our import statement
        - the thing at the end of your import statement must be a module or a variable, function or class
        - we can rename a module using `as`
            - `import numpy as np`
        - in python, importing a module runs the whole file
    - if name == main
        - we might have a file that when we run it explicitly, it computes some things
        - but it might also contain some stuff which we want to import into other code
        - we want a way to say, only run this block of code if the user run this file directly
        - useful for when we want to import that code without 
- [CHALLENGE] (10 mins) 
    - part 1: 3rd party libraries
        - install pandas using conda 
        - import pandas into your python script
        - give pandas an alias "pd" upon importing
        - from pandas, import the `DataFrame` class
    - part 2: local imports
        - create a folder called import_challenge and open it in vscode
        - in the folder create 2 files called 'main.py' and 'utils.py'
        - in the utils file, create a function called 'greeting' which prints a nice greeting
        - in the utils file, call this function
        - in the main file, import the greeting function from utils and run it
        - notice how the function gets run twice? once when the file is imported, and once when we called it directly. To stop this, let's put the direct call in an if name equals main block (feel free to look it up if you forget the syntax)
        - in this folder, create 2 folders called 'people' and 'sports'
        - in the people folder, create a file with a variable in, that is a list of the names of your group members
        - import this list into the main file and print it
        - inside the sports folder, create another 2 folders, called "skiing" and "climbing"
        - in each of these, define a simple class which has an initialiser that prints the name of the sport and a method called `equipment` which prints a the name of the sport and a piece of equipment you need to do it
        - try to import a module that does not exist, and handle this error with a try/except block

create your own nested file structure and python files with functions, variables and classes in and make sure you're comfortable with the imports
