questions:
  - question: Create a lambda function that takes a string and returns the string in all uppercase, along with its length. Use the function in all elements of a list
  - question: Create a lambda function that will sort a list of strings by the second character in the string. Use the function in all elements of a list
  - question: Create a decorator that prints the arguments passed to the function before it is called.
  - question: "Observe the following code:
      \n\n `class Date`:
      \n\n\t  def __init__(self, day, month, year):
      \n\n\t\t    self.day = day
      \n\n\t\t    self.month = month
      \n\n\t\t    self.year = year

      \n Create a classmethod that allows the user to instantiate a Date class using a string

      For example '19-05-1991'"

  - question: The class Date you saw in the notebook is not very accurate. The `is_date_valid` method should take into account dates from different months. Correct it
  - question: What is a generator and how is it different to a list or a tuple?
  - question: Create a generator that generates even numbers between 1 and 100
  - question: How can I force a generator to compute all of the values so that I can print them?
  - question: What is a package? What is PyPI? What's a package manager?
  - question: What's the key difference between the package managers apt and pip? Where does bash look for packages?
  - question: Where does Python look for packages?
  - question: What's the difference between pip and conda?
  - question: What code runs in a file which you import it and when?
  - question: How can I import a specific function called myfunction from within a file called myfile without everything else?
  - question: What do I have to do differently to import variables? What about classes?
