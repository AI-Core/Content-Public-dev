# Imports and Context Managers

## Setup

### What do I need open?
- VSCode open on the home page
    - `.imports_context.ipynb` notebook
    - `example_module.py`
    - `example_module_2.py`
    - The Document Explorer on the left hand side might be helpful to show the files that are in the directory (for importing and opening files)
- OBS

- It might be worth testing how fast you can change tabs while recording on OBS. If it takes too long, maybe it can be edited, or I can change the script
    

### What recording scenes do I need open?

- Screencapture of VSCode with your webcam capture in the corner
- Webcam capture in full screen

## Script

_START SCENE] webcam in full screen_

- amazingly, you can use code which people all over the world have published online
- to do this, you can use a package manager
- a package manager handles getting the source code from off the internet and putting it somewhere that you can access it from your code
- if you want to install software to run new terminal commands, then you should use a _system package manager_
    - if you're on linux that will be apt
    - if you're on mac that will be brew 
- package managers are language specific
- to install 3rd party python code, you will need to use a PYTHON package manager, like conda
- another python package manager one is pip, which works in a similar way
- even though pip and conda are python package managers, they are run from the command line



- you can also write your own code that can be imported into your programs
- we call any python file that contains anything we might want to import a _module_
- we can import anything defined in python: classes functions, or really any variable
- Usually, if a directory contains several modules, we call that directory package
- Let's see some examples to see how imports work

_SWITCH SCENE OPEN VSCode_

_open .imports_context.ipynb_

- importing modules straightforward. 
- We use the keyword `import` followed by the name of the script or the module we want to bring to our code
- So, in this example, we are importing a module named `example_module`
- And we can see that this module is in the same directory

_SHOW WITH THE MOUSE THAT example_module.py IS IN THE SAME DIRECTORY_

- A key thing that you need to understand about imports is that they don't bring specific parts of the code
- An import will run the whole file you are importing, not just a specific part
- Before importing the module, let's check what's inside

_oPEN example_module.py_

- The file simply contains a function, a print statement, and two variables, `x`, and `y`

_open .imports_context.ipynb_

- So, after running this, we can see the print 
- And now we can access the function and the variables inside the module

- __`[NEXT CELL] example_module.function_example`__
- To access variables or functions, we need to specify the module they are in followed by their name
- So here we can see that the output prints the body of the function, and then it prints the value of `x`
- This module prefix can help distinguish the variables we have in our current code and the variables defined in the module we are importing, as there's nothing stopping them from having the same name

- For example, you can see that if we define a new variable `y` in our notebook, it will NOT replace the value of `y` we import from the module

- One thing to take into account with imports is that after we import a module, Python will assume it has been already imported and will NOT run the file again if it hits another import statement for the same module
- this is an exception to the rule that an import statement runs the file being imported
- We can see that there is no output now. So we need to restart the kernel
- This is because we are working in a notebook, and the imported objects is stored in the Python notebook memory
- So if we want to import again the module, we need to restart the kernel 

_RESTART THE KERNEL_

_NEXT CELL] from example_module import x_
- Now that we have restarted the kernel, we can import the module again
- But instead of importing the whole module, let's import a variable in that module, `x`
- You can do this by using the `from` keyword
- The whole module has been executed, but now we can get the value of `x` directly
- remember, even if we try to only import certain parts of the code, the whole module will run
- but, any other variables which ran in that file will not be accessible

## Import aliases
- it's also worth mentioning here that modules and variables within them can be imported with different name by using the as keyword
- you typically do this if 
    - your import has a long name
    - you know that you're going to be writing out the import name a lot
    - or you are specifically avoiding a variable name clash
- some libraries like numpy and pandas have canonical import aliases which everyone uses

_Show import numpy as np and pandas as pd_

##

_OPEN example_module_2_
- This module is the same as the first example except for this _if name == main block_
- This `if` condition is something you will see all over the place, and that you should use in most of your scripts
- it looks complicated but all it means is that the code within the block will only run if this file is run directly, that is if this file is the main file
- and that's what the condition is checking
- `__name__` is a builtin variable that is always available, and it stores the name which python stored for this file
- python calls the file which you've run directly, `__main__`
- if you print the `__name__` within a file you're importing, it will be equal to the name of the module
- so once again, the code in the block will only be executed if we run this file directly
- And will be skipped if we import it into another file, which would run the file indirectly

_Run file from terminal_

- You can see the print now

_OPEN .imports_context.ipynb_
 
_import example_module_2_

- But if we import this module, not running it directly, we don't see the print statement inside the `if name == main` block
- for example, you might have a file that has lots of useful functions for processing data in, 
    - you might want to import these functions into other programs
    - but when you run this file directly, you want to run code that puts them all together to run the data processing pipeline
    - so you would put that code in the `if __name__ == '__main__'` block
    - and it wouldnt run the whole pipeline when you import from the file

_NEXT CELL import sys_
- it is important to know how Python will look for the imports
- Python will look for modules and packages in the directories included in what is known as the _Pythonpath_
- you can see your pythonpath in the terminal by running `echo $PYTHONPATH`, which shows each directory separated by colons
- and you can access it in python by importing `sys` and running `sys.path`, which is a list
- Python will look first in the directory that contains the script we are executing
- And then it will look through the list of directories in the pythonpath in order
- when you install new packages, your python package manager should save them into one of these folders so python can find them
- These directories will vary when you move between virtual environments
- So make sure that when you import packages, you are in the right virtual environment!

## Context managers

- you can only import python files, not other type of files, like text or image files
- but, we can use the builtin `open` function, to open any file type
- it returns a variable that has methods for reading and writing to that file, amongst other things


- an easy mistake to make is not closing the file after you're done with it so that it continues to occupy memory
- this is known as a memory leak
- if you're opening lots of files or just working with limited memory this can cause the system to slow down or even crash

- Let's see an example of that happening

_OPEN .imports_context.ipynb_

- This cell will create a file named `test.txt` without closing it ten thousand times
- It will reach a point where too many file objects are open
- And Python will throw an error complaining that there are too many files opened and can't open any additional file
- We could avoid it if we properly managed these resources

- what we should have done, is closed the file

_Show closing the file_

- but closing the file is easy to forget, and it takes up more lines than the best way to do it
- the best way to do it would be to use what is called a context manager
- they start with the python keyword `with`
- then they expect a certain object like what is returned from `open` to be assigned to a temporary variable which follows the `as` keyword
- and then a colon to indicate the start of an indented block
- the temporary variable can be referenced inside the block
- we call everything in the block, the context
- what's key about the objects that can be used here is that under the hood, they have magic methods defined for how to enter the context, and how to leave the context
- in our case, entering the context opens the file
- and exiting the block closes the file
- so we don't have to remember to close it manually or even write the code out

- context managers are used all over the place for when you want some temporary behaviour
- some other examples would be making and closing database connections 
- creating temporary folders
- or running a machine learning model in a certain mode
