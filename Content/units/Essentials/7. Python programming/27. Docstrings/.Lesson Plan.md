# 4. Docstring and Typing

- Explain why well documented code is important
- Docstring
    - Is it the same as Commenting?
    - Commenting is used to explain users or other developers about parts of your code
    - It can be used for defining sections of your code, describe algorithms, or tagging
    - [DEMO] in VSCode, # TODO looks different for example

    - They differ from docstring in the sense that docstring doctrings are used for telling users or others developers what a function, method, class, script or module is doing.
    - You can check the docstring of a class using `__doc__`
    - You can check the docstring using the built-in function help()
    - Another difference is how they are defined
        - While comments are implemented using #, docstrings need to be between ''' '''
        - [DEMO]:
            - Implement a docstring for a dummy function
            - Try it woth comments #
            - Try it with ''' '''
            - Check help() in both of them
        - Show how to implement a docstring for a class
            - Mention exceptions:
                - If you want to use a docstring for a class, you need to define a docstring for each method in the class.
                - `__init__` doesn't necessarily have a docstring.
                - Private methods don't have docstrings. Just a comment
        - Show hot to implement doctring in a module
            - [DEMO] Go to Date.py and show the docstring
            - Import Date.py and call for help()
        - Show how to implement a docstring for being shown in the CLI
            - [DEMO] Go to spreadsheet_printer.py and show the docstring
        - Show the four main types of docstrings
            - Google
            - reStructuredText
            - NumpyDocstring
            - Epytext
    - Typing
        - [DEMO] Create a function using BeatifulSoup
        - Show that the function can either return a BeatifulSoup object or None
        - We can use Union
        - We can use Optional
        - Show what type of hints we can use in the typing library
    
    - Typechecker: mypy
        - We can check that the code is fulfilling the type specifications
        - [DEMO] Create a function using BeatifulSoup
        - Show that we can check the typing using mypy in the CLI
        - This is going to be tested for their projects
    - Challenges
