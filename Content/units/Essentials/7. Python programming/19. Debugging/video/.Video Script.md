# Debugging

## Setup

### Before the video

- Create a new virtual environment where pandas is not installed
- Activate that virtual environment in both the terminal and the notebook
    - Make sure that you can install pandas and make it run in this virtual environment after installing it
        - If it doesn't work, you will need to use `python -m pip install pandas`. If that's the case, say it during the video
    - Then, uninstall pandas for the demostration

### What do i need open?
- VSCode open on the home page
    - `.debugging.ipynb` file
    - Terminal Open in VSCode with the new virtual environment activated

<br>

- Keynote:
    - 10. Debugging.key

<br>

- Open Browser for googling:
    - First search: add new key to dictionary python
    - Second Search: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'
    - Third Search: "Pandas KeyError"

<br>

- OBS

### What recording scenes do I need open?

- Screencapture of vscode with your webcam capture in the corner
- Webcam capture in full screen
- Safari (or any browser) with Google open

## Script
- __`[START SCENE] webcam in full screen`__
    - In this lesson we are not going to learn a specific Python programming technique
    - Instead, we are going to show you something crucial that people seem to fail to do when they start learning Python
        - We are going to show you how to interpret the errors that you might find when working with Python.
    - Usually, an error in a script is called `bug`, and the process of fixing it is called `debugging`

    - By being able to read the errors given by Python you will develop a level of self-learning characteristic of the best programmers. 
    - What I mean by this is that, if you learn how to read the errors, you will know how to solve the problem by yourself.
    - This will escalate into being able to understand larger issues because you already know how to solve smaller pieces of the bigger problem.
    - So, in this lesson, we will give you hints on how to read the errors given by Python, and some heuristics about how to debug your code.

    - You might think that the steps we are going to show you are state-of-the-art techniques from Python
    - But reality is that 99% of the times, a problem can be solved by Google.
    - Even though you think the best programmers out there know every single method, function, or programming command in Python, truth is that they spend a large amount of the time googling problems.
    - Of course, the more you code, the better you become at it, and eventually, the most common commands will come to you naturally
        - But that doesn't mean that you will need to remember every single command

- __`[CHANGE SCENE] Open Keynote 10.Debugging.key`__
    - Usually, the debugging process looks like this
    - Python throws an error.
    - You should read the error and, using google, search for a solution
    - Then, you will try to implement that solution in your code
    - And observe: Did the solution work?
        - If yes, nice work!
        - Otherwise, read again the error, if you keep getting the same error, you might need to refine the search, or look for additional webpages
    - On that note, one trusted source of information is Stackoverflow
    - Stackoverflow is a public platform where people can post questions, usually related to programming, and the community provides answers and solutions

- Let's see how Stackoverflow looks like
- __`[CHANGE SCENE] Open Browser`__
    - First, I am going to search for an issue related to Python
    - Let's say that I want to add new keys to a dictionary in Python
- __`[OPEN BROWSER] Google: "add new key to dictionary python"`__
- __`The first search should be from Stackoverflow`__
    - It's no surprise that the first result is from Stackoverflow
    - Let's click on it

<br>

- __`[OPEN LINK] "How can I add new keys to a dictionary? - Stack Overflow"`__
- __`[USING THE MOUSE] Point to the question section`__
    - The first thing you will see is the question posted by a user
    - Then, the answers provided by the community are below

<br>

- __`[SCROLL DOWN] Go to the first answer`__
    - The first answer is usually the most upvoted one
    - So it is usually the one you will want to try in your code
    - We can see how to create new keys in a dictionary
    - And thanks to the Stackoverflow community we can also understand how it works. They don't usually limit themselves to just post a block of code

<br>

- __`[SCROLL DOWN] Go to the Second answer`__
    - Most questions have more than one single answer
    - If you keep scrolling you might find more useful information
    - Thus, if the first option didn't convince you, you can still use more alternatives!

<br>

- OK, so let's take a look at the process of debugging a Python code
- __`[CHANGE SCENE] Open VSCode`__
- __`[FIRST CELL] import pandas as pd`__
    - This example uses pandas to create a dataframe and then it will add all its numbers
    - Don't worry too much about the implementation right now
    - Just focus on the output that we get after running this cell
    - So, apparently there is an error in this cell, let's see the error to see where it happens
    - Python has a great way to tell the user how to find the error.
    - The arrow shows that the error is in line 1
    - By the way, you can observe the line number in a cell by selecting the cell and pressing `L` `[SHOW HOW TO DO IT BY Pressing on the left hand side of the cell and pressing L]`
    - So, in line 1, the problem comes when we try to import pandas
    - If we read the final message in the error, that will tell us the reason of the error
    - Thus, the error is due to pandas not being found.
    - So, how do we solve it?
    - Let's copy paste the error into Google!
    - `[SELECT THE ERROR AND COPY IT]`

<br>

- __`[CHANGE SCENE] Open Browser`__
- __`[PASTE THE ERROR IN GOOGLE]`__
    - Once again, the first result is from Stackoverflow
    - Let's take a look at the first solution
- __`[SCROLL DOWN TO THE FIRST ANSWER]`__
    - Apparently we can use `pip install wheel` and `pip install pandas`
    - In our case, `wheel` is usually installed, so let's just install pandas
    - Let's go to the terminal and type `pip install pandas`

- __`[CHANGE SCENE] OPEN VSCODE. The terminal should already be open with the right virtual environment`__
    - We can use the terminal to install pandas
- __`[RUN IN THE TERMINAL] pip install pandas`__
    - This should start the pandas installation
- __`[It might take a while, so maybe pause the video]`__
    - I am going to pause the video while it's installing and we'll come back when it's done
    - `[WAIT UNTIL INSTALLED AND RESUME RECORDING]`
    - Ok, now, I am going to reset the notebook to make the changes effective
    - `[RESTART THE KERNEL]`
    - And I am going to run the cell to see if this works now
    - `[RUN THE CELL] you will get another error`
    - Hmmm, it looks like there is an error... But wait, the message is now different
    - We can see that in line 4, df_1 doesn't exist
    - If we traceback the code, we can see that, indeed, we don't have any other variable named df_1
    - Oh, my bad, it was just df

- __`[NEXT CELL]`__
    - Ok, now it's corrected, so it should work... right?
    - Oh no... This error looks even longer
    - Luckily, Python gives detailed information about the error
    - Apparently, the error is given by a KeyError: 'c'
    - Let's say what Google has to say
    - This error is quite specific for our problem, so let's google something more generic, like: "Pandas KeyError"


- __`[CHANGE SCENE] Open Browser`__
- __`[GOOGLE PANDAS KEYERROR]`__
    - The first option is not StackOverflow, but it might work, so let's give it a shot
- __`[OPEN FIRST URL] IT should be from dataindependet.com`__
- __`[SCROLL DOWN UNTIL THE FIRST SENTENCE] "Pandas KeyError is frustrating..."`__
    - Nice, we don't have to scroll down too much and we already know what's going on
    - Apparently the error happens because pandas can't find the key
    - If we keep reading we can see that we can fix it by making sure that the column is in the dataframe
    - Let's see in our dataframe if column 'c' is in the dataframe

<br>

- Let's print out the dataframe we have
- __`[CHANGE SCENE] OPEN VSCODE`__
- __`[NEXT CELL] The one without total`__
    - Yes, it looks like our dataframe didn't contain column 'c'!
    - Ok, we can add column 'c' to the dataframe, or change the formula for the total value we had before
    - Let's simply change that equation and see if we get the same error
    - So, we are replacing 'c' for 'b', which is a column we do have in the dataframe

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] The last one`__
    - Observe that now, the equation doesn't reference column 'c'
    - After running the cell everything seems to work fine: Great job!

## Summary

- __`[SWITCH SCENE] webcam in full screen`__
    - We were able to solve different issues following a simple rule:
        - Read the error prompt
    - This gave us information about the error, not only the cause, but also what line was responsible

    - So, let's summarize what we learnt today
        - You learnt the concept of debugging
        - You learnt how to read an error thrown by Python
        - You saw that googling your error is usually a good starting point if you don't know how to solve the problem
        - You now know that Stackoverflow is a good source of answers
        - But don't limit yourself to stackoverflow
        - With time and practice you will be able to discern between good and bad sources
