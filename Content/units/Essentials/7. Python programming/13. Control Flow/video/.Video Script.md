## Introduction

- __`[SHOW WEBCAM] Capture in full screen`__

- It feels natural that, when you read code, you do it line by line, without skipping any line or repeating any piece of code. 
- However, in Python, we can control the sequence in which the code is executed
- This is called Control Flow

- In Python, there are three main types of Control Flow tools:
    - If
    - While
    - For

- In this lesson, we will see the first two methods: If and while. 

- We will not dive into `for` loops just yet

## If Statement

*For this section, get the .if.py, if.png, if_else.png, and if_elif.png files prepared*

- __`[SHOW] if.png`__

    - Often, you need to execute some statements only if some condition is met
    - Python uses `if` statement to run a piece of code <font size=+1> _if_ </font> the condition is fulfilled 
    - We can see in the image how the if statement works
        - The if statement checks whether the logical operation returns True or False
        - If it is True, it will execute the code in the green block
        - Otherwise, it will skip that piece of code

- So, how do we translate that into Python code? The code looks something like this

<br>

- __`[FIRST CELL] It's all between triple quotes`__
    - The code starts with the keyword `if.`
    - Then, we add the condition that will be checked
    - Don't forget to add a colon
    - The code to be executed in case the condition is True is indented. 
    - Indentation is a way of telling a Python interpreter that the group of statements belongs to a particular block of code
    - So, in this case, we are indicating that the indented code belongs to the if statement
    - To tell Python that we are finished specifying the inner block of code, we can simply remove the indentation

<br>

- Let's see an example
- __`[NEXT CELL] x = 5`__
    - In this case, the condition is that x has to be greater than 3
    - In our case, x is five, so the condition is True
    - Thus, the block inside the if statement runs, and the message is printed out

<br>

- However, let's see what happens when the condition is not met
- __`[NEXT CELL] x = 1`__
    - The same condition remains, but now the value of x is 1
    - Thus, the condition is not met, and therefore the block inside the if statement is skipped

- In many ocassions we need to perform certain operations if the condition is False
- For those cases, we can use the <font size=+1> _optional_ </font> else statement

## If else statement

- __`[SHOW] if_else.png`__
    - If we add an else statement, it will also include a block of code, like in the if statement
    - This block of code will run only if the condition returns False

<br>

- In Python, the code for using an if-else statement looks like this:
- __`[NEXT CELL] if-else between triple quotes`__
    - The syntax is very similar to the syntax for the single if statement
    - Observe that `else` is at the same level of indentation as `if`.
    - Also, notice that else doesn't have any condition because if the condition is not met, the block in the else statement will always run

<br>

- Let's use a similar example:
- __`[NEXT CELL] x = 5 with else`__
    - Once again, the condition is that x has to be greater than 3
    - But now, if that condition doesn't hold, the block corresponding to the else statement is executed
    - In this case, x is indeed greater than 3, so the block in the if statement is printed out

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] x = 1 with else`__
    - However, if x is lower than 3, the first condition doesn't hold
    - And therefore, the line in the else statement is printed out

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] x = 3`__
    - Using an if-else statement forces us to work with absolutes; it's either True or False
    - For example, if x is 3, the first condition is not met, so the line in the else statement is printed out  
    - However, x is not lower than 3 either
    - We can use a more robust method for checking more than just one condition

## Elif statement

- We can use the elif statement to add more conditions in case the first condition is not met
- __`[SHOW] if_elif.png`__ 
    - Notice that if both conditions are True, the block of code inside the elif statement will not run
    - Following that logic, the block in the else statement will only run if none of the conditions is met

<br>

- In Python, you can write an if-elif-else statement like this:
- __`[NEXT CELL] if elif between triple quotes`__
    - The syntax is very similar
    - It is worth mentioning that the elif and else statements are optional

<br>

- Let's see this in action:

- __`[NEXT CELL] x = 3 with elif`__
    - This control flow has two conditions:
        - The first condition checks if the number is greater than 3
        - The second one checks if the number is equal to 3
    - If none of these conditions is met, the code inside the else statement runs
    - You can see that after running the cell, the code inside the elif statement runs.
    - This is because the first condition is false, but the second one is True

## While 
_Open .while.py, while.png, and switch to a full-screen webcam capture_
- __`[SHOW WEBCAM] Capture in full screen`__
    - You have just learnt how to execute certain blocks of code if a condition or conditions hold.
    - This will allow us to have a certain level of control of the flow of the script
    - Apart from that, it is likely that you will need to repeat a block of code <font size=+1> _while_ </font> a specific condition holds.
    - To do so, we use the while statement:

- __`[SWITCH to images][SHOW] while.png`__
    - We can see in the diagram that the script enters the while loop and checks a condition
    - If the condition is True, the block is executed, and the condition is checked again
    - It will repeat the previous step until the condition is False
    - Notice that, if the condition is always True, the loop will run infinitely
    - If you are trapped in an infinite loop, you can press Crtl + C

<br>

- __`[SWITCH to VSCode] .while.py`__
- In Python, a while loop looks like this:
- __`[FIRST CELL] It's all between triple quotes`__
    - It starts with the while keyword
    - Then, we add the condition to be checked
    - Again, don't forget the colon
    - The block of indented code is the code that will be repeated until the condition is not met anymore
    - Notice that if, before starting the while loop, the condition is not met, the block of code will be directly skipped

- Let's see a practical example:
- __`[NEXT CELL] x = 0`__
    - At each iteration, first, the value of x is printed out
    - Then, the value of x is incremented by one
    - After that, Python will check if the value of x is lower than 5
        - If it is, we repeat the code
        - Otherwise, we get out of the loop

- In the `if` statement, we could add an `else` statement in case the `if` condition was False
- It would be logical that the while statement also have an `else` statement
- Let's ask Google!
- __`[OPEN BROWSER] Google: can we use else with while loop in python`__
    - Oh, we have a stackoverflow answer
    - let's check that out
- __`[OPEN LINK] Open the 4th link, the one from StackOverflow__
    - Let's scroll down to check an answer
- __`[SCROLL DOWN] Go to the first answer`__
    - The else clause is only executed when your while condition becomes false.
    - So, according to StackOverflow, we can use else statement, and it works similar to an else statement in an if statement

- Let's check the answer by going through an example:
- __`[NEXT CELL] while with else`__
    - Observe that, after finishing the code in the while loop, it will run the code inside the else statement

<br>

- The code inside the else statement can run if the condition is not met a priori
- __`[NEXT CELL] x = 10`__
    - In the example, the condition is not met even before starting the while statement, so it goes straight to the else statement

## Infinite loop and break statement

- If the condition in the while loop is always True, it will run indefinitely, which is not ideal...
- Take a look at this example:
- __`[NEXT CELL] x = 3`__
    - In this case, x will always remain the same, and always satisfy the condition
    - Oh no! the loop will run forever! 
    - Well, not forever, it will run until you stop it pressing Ctrl + C or pressing the Stop button if you are in a notebook `[Point to the Interrupt button when running it on the interactive window].`

- Usually, you will use an infinite loop if the condition is complex or you are unsure when to stop iterating
- In that case, you can add a break statement inside the loop to define where to stop
- __`[NEXT CELL] while with break`__
    - When break executes, the loop terminates, even if there is still code to run inside the loop
    - for example, you can see that everything below the break statement wasn't executed

- There is still one more type of loop, `for` loops, but for now, this has been enough for this lesson!
