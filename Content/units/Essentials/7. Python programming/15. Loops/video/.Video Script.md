## Introduction

- __`[SHOW WEBCAM] Capture in full screen`__
    - There are different ways to control the flow of your Python code
        - For instance, you can use the if-else statement, the while loop or the `for` loop
    - Here, we are going to focus on a type of loop: the `for` loop
    - A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence or a collection of items, such as a list, set, tuple or dictionary
    - You can also iterate through strings, where each character is considered as an item 
    - Another thing you can do is loop through a set of codes a specified number of times.
    - Looping is a good example of the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) because you don't have to rewrite a piece of code multiple times
- __`[CHANGE TO VSCODE] Open .for.py`__
- Let's see the basic syntax of a for `loop` in Python:

<br>

- __`[FIRST CELL]`__ 
    - First, we use the for keyword
    - Then, we use a `placeholder` that will take the value of each element in the sequence in a given iteration
    - We can use `placeholder` as a variable inside the loop, and it will take a different value at each iteration
    - Then, we use the keyword `in` that indicates the placeholder variable will take the values _in_ the sequence
    - `Sequence` refers to the collection of items over which we want to perform the looping
    - Don't forget the colon! This is a common error when starting coding
    - Finally, we include the set of code that we want to repeat until the sequence runs out of items to loop through

<br>

- Everything is easier to understand if we see a practical example:
- __`[NEXT CELL] coding_languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'Go', 'C++', 'Pascal']`__
    - In this example, the placeholder is `language`
    - And sequence is `coding_languages`
    - Observe that at each iteration, the value of language changes
    - At each loop, language takes the value of each item in the coding_languages list
    - It will take first the value Python, then Java, and so on and so forth

<br>

- The same way you can iterate through lists, you can also iterate through dictionaries
- __`[NEXT CELL] dict_languages`__
    - By default, if we try to loop over a dictionary, the placeholder will take the value of the keys 
    - Observe that the output only prints the name of the programming languages

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] indexing the key to the dictionary`__
    - We already know how to access the values corresponding to each key
    - We can simply index the key to the dictionary to get the corresponding value

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] using dict_languages.items()`__
    - Another way to get the keys and the values are using the `items()` method from dictionaries. 
    - Remember that this method returns a list where each item is a tuple containing the key and the value
    - So the tuple will be unpacked in the for loop
    - In this example, you can see that `k` is taking the value of the key, and `v` is taking the value corresponding to that key

<br>

- For loops are also used to loop through a set of code a specified number of times
- __`[NEXT CELL] range(10)`__
    - To do so, Python has a special data type named range
    - The range type represents an immutable sequence of numbers 
    - Just by itself, you can see that it doesn't provide much information; it basically says that it's a range type from 0 to 10
    - You can see its content by casting the range type into an integer
        - That will return a list with numbers from 0 to 10 (not inclusive)

- The range type has more arguments than the final number
- However, sometimes, you might forget the order in which the arguments have to be input
- So let's Google it
- __`[OPEN BROWSER] Google: python range`__
    - Good, the second result is from the official Python documentation, let's take a look at it
- __`[OPEN URL] Second result: Built-in Functions â€” Python 3.10.0 documentation`__
    - We can loop for the range() type in the table
- __`[CLICK] range()`__
- __`[CLICK AGAIN] range()`__
    - From the documentation, we can see that range can accept up to three arguments, start, stop, and step in that order
    - The documentation is quite well explained
        - Start is the value of the start parameter (or 0 by default)
        - Stop is the value of the stop parameter
        - Step is the value of the step parameter (or 1 by default)

<br>

- __`[GO BACK TO VSCODE]`__
- Let's put the documentation into practice using for loops
- We can see how all arguments work in the range type
- __`[NEXT CELL] for x in range(5)`__
    - If we add just one argument, it will return a list from 0 to 4

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] for x in range(3, 5)`__
    - If we add two arguments, it will return a list from the first argument to the second argument

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] for x in range(2, 10, 2)`__
    - If we add three arguments, it will return a list from the first argument to the second argument using a step size equal to the third argument

## Break, Pass, Continue

- We can have more control over the flow of the code within the for loop

- The break statement will exit the loop as soon as the code reaches the break statement
- __`[NEXT CELL] for x in range(100)`__
    - In this example, once the loop reaches 20, the break statement will be reached, and the loop will terminate

<br>

- The pass statement acts as a placeholder when working on new code and thinking on an algorithmic level
- __`[NEXT CELL] for x in range(5)`__
    - Basically, we are going to use `pass` when we are developing, and we are still thinking about the implementation
    - In the example, you can see that the pass statement does nothing; the loop acts exactly the same

<br>

- The continue statement will disrupt the current iteration, and the program will return to the top of the loop
- __`[NEXT CELL] for x in range(5)`__
    - In this example, at the beginning of each iteration, it will print the value of x
    - After that, we can see that if the number is divisible by 2, the code reaches the continue statement, and it will go to the top of the for loop
    - However, if the number is not divisible by 2, the loop runs the whole code inside it
    - So, we can conclude that continue skips whatever is remaining in the code at that iteration

## Zip and Enumerate

- There is a couple of special classes in Python: zip and enumerate, which are both quite useful in `for` loops
- __`[SWITCH TO KEYNOTE]`__
- __`[FIRST SLIDE] zip`__
    - The zip function accepts two sequences and returns a sequence of tuples where the first item in each passed iterator is paired together, and then the second item in each passed iterator are paired together, and so on and so forth

- __`[SWITCH TO VSCODE]`__
- __`[NEXT CELL] years = [5, 3, 2, 10, 15]`__
    - This example shows how to use the zip function in Python
    - You can see that it returns a list with tuples
    - Just like the items method from dictionaries
    - So, we can use it a for loop to loop through both elements simultaneously

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] for year, language in zip(year, coding_languages):`__
    - Using the zip function allows us to unpack the tuples in the for loop
    - In this example, we obtain something similar to what we obtained when we obtained the items method in a previous example

<br>

- Enumerate has a similar use to zip, but it will assign a number to each item of the sequence we pass to the enumerate function
- __`[NEXT CELL] for year, language in enumerate(coding_languages)`__
    - The number assigned to each element is the iteration number
    - We can see that the first iteration starts at zero
    - However, requiring 0 years of experience in Python seems to be a dream!

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] for year, language in enumerate(coding_languages, start=1)`__
    - We can change the start number by adding an argument to the enumerate function


## Comprehension Lists

- One common thing you will want to do is append elements to a list
- For example, let's say that you want to create a list where each item is the cube of the first ten numbers
- __`[NEXT CELL] cube=[]`__
    - This example starts with an empty list
    - Then, the code goes through a loop from 1 to 10, inclusive
    - At each iteration, we append the cube of each element in the range to the empty list

- There is a much more efficient way of writing a for loop which generates or modifies a list.
- This method consists of using comprehension lists, which are written in a single list like this

- __`[NEXT CELL] cube = [i ** 3 for i in range(1, 11)]`__
    - We can see that the comprehension list is defined using square brackets as well
    - The first element in the comprehension list is the operation that we perform inside the for loop
    - Then, we add the `for` keyword
    - Then, we use the `placeholder` that will iterate through the sequence
    - Similar to regular `for` loops, we also add the `in` keyword
    - And finally, we define the sequence that will be looped through
    - Even though this looks a little bit convoluted now, once you get used to the Python syntax, you will actually feel much more comfortable working with comprehension lists rather than with regular `for` loops

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] cube = {i ** 3 for i in range(1, 11)}`__
    - You can also create comprehension sets by replacing the square brackets with curly brackets
    - So, you can see in this example that the output doesn't have any order, which is a characteristic of sets

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] cube = {i: i ** 3 for i in range(1, 11)}`__
    - You can even create dictionaries if you also add a key to the operation to be performed
    - For example, here, we are defining a dictionary where each key is a number from 1 to 10
    - And the corresponding value is its cube

<br>

- So, it seems apparent that replacing square brackets for parentheses will create a tuple comprehension
- Let's take a look at Google and see if that's the case
- __`[OPEN BROWSER] Google: tuple comprehension python`__
    - The first result is from stackoverflow, a usually good source of information,
    - However, we can already see the question: "Why is there no tuple comprehension in Python?"
    - Let's take a look at it to see what's going on
- __`[OPEN LINK] Click the stackoverflow link`__
- __`[SCROLL DOWN TO THE ANSWER] Read the answer out loud`__
    - It looks like we need to cast the output of a comprehension to a tuple using the reserved python function `tuple`.
    - If we simply use parentheses, we will obtain a generator, which is a topic we won't cover in this lesson

- Before moving on, it is essential to highlight that comprehension lists are efficient and make the code more readable
- But don't overdo it; the more code you add to a comprehension list, the more unreadable it becomes

## Nested loops

- To finish off this lesson, let's take a look at a particular case of loops: nested loops
- __`[SWITCH TO KEYNOTE]`__
- __`[NEXT SLIDE] The one with the nested loop`__
    - In essence, a nested loop is a loop inside a loop
    - The inner loop will finish iterating over all the elements in its sequence before the outer loop iterates through its next item

<br>

- __`[OPEN VSCode]`__
- Let's see an example of this in Python
- __`[NEXT CELL] for x in range(3):`__
    - You can see in the output that y has to iterate through all the range from 0 to 3 before x can loop through its next iteration
