    "# Editing Files in the Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "> From time to time, it is necessary to edit files directly from the command line. While simple edits can be performed inside the command line itself, using only the shell scripting language (eg. Bash or Powershell), more advanced edits are performed using a command line interface (CLI) based text editor. \n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Why learn to use a CLI-based text editor? While GUI text editors (like Microsoft Word or Notepad) can be more intuitive and user-friendly, especially for beginners, CLI text editors can offer a great deal of power and flexibility for those willing to learn them, and there are several situations where you might prefer using a CLI text editor over a GUI-based one: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remote Access**: When you're connecting into a remote computer, you often don't have access to a GUI and a CLI-based text editor is all you have to work with\n",
    "- **Automation**: CLI text editors can be easily incorporated into scripts and automated tasks\n",
    "- **Speed:** If you're good with a CLI text editor, it can be much faster to make edits with keyboard commands than using a mouse in a GUI editor\n",
    "- **Saving Resources:** CLI text editors generally consume less computer power compared to GUI editors\n",
    "- **Compatibility:** CLI text editors are standard tools available by default on almost all systems, allowing you to work on different systems without having to learn new software.\n",
    "- **Stability:** CLI text editors are incredibly stable and less prone to crashes compared to many GUI applications"

    "## File Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start editing files, it is useful to understand a little about file permissions. \n",
    "\n",
    ">File permissions are rules that dictate who can look at, change, or run a file on a computer. They are used to prevent unauthorised users from taking certain actions. They help improve system security making sure that only the right people can look at or modify sensitive information, and also prevent users from accidentally or intentionally messing up or deleting important files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short you may not be able to edit, move or even read from a file unless the correct permissions are set, so it is important to understand how to understand and change them when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Permissions in Unix-Based Systems (Mac and Linux)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix-based systems have a simple but flexible permissions system. For each file, there will be permissions settings for each of three groups: \n",
    "- **The Owner**: The person who owns the file\n",
    "- **The Group**: A group of users that the owner belongs to \n",
    "- **The Others**: Everybody else using the computer\n",
    " \n",
    "Each group can have different rules. For example, if you (the owner) had a file which acted as a personal diary, you might let your friends (the group) look at your diary but not write in it, while not letting anyone else (others) even see it. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Another related category of user on Unix systems is the *superuser*, also often called *root*. This is a special user account which has full administrative privileges and unrestricted access to all commands, files, and resources on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike regular users who are restricted to making changes within their own directories and files, the root user can read, modify, and delete any file on the system, stop and start services, install and uninstall applications, manage user accounts, and change ownership of files. This makes the root account incredibly powerful, but also potentially dangerous if used improperly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are logged in under a user account, but need to make changes at superuser level, you can do so by using the command [`sudo`](https://xkcd.com/149/), followed by the command-line instruction you wish to execute. You will then be prompted for the password of the root account, to prove that you have permission to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Permission\n",
    "\n",
    "For each user group, three types of permissions can be set on a file or directory: `read` (r), `write` (w), and `execute` (x).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`read` (r):** The read permission allows a user to list the files in the directory or read the contents of the file\n",
    "- **`write` (w):** The write permission allows a user to add, remove, or modify files in the directory or modify the contents of the file. Note that write permission on a directory allows the user to delete any file within that directory, regardless of the file's own permissions.\n",
    "- **` execute` (x):** For a directory, the execute permission allows a user to enter the directory, and access files and directories inside. For a file, it allows the user to run the file as a program or script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting File Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Unix systems, file permissions are set using the `chmod` (change mode) command. Permissions can be set in symbolic mode or numeric mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. #### Symbolic Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for symbolic mode is `chmod [ugoa][+-=][rwx] filename`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The users are represented as:\n",
    "    - u (user/owner) \n",
    "    - g (group)\n",
    "    - o (others) \n",
    "    - a (all: user, group, and others)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The operations are represented as \n",
    "    - \\+ (add permission)\n",
    "    - \\- (remove permission)\n",
    "    - = (set exact permission)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The permissions are:\n",
    "    - r (read)\n",
    "    - w (write) \n",
    "    - x (execute)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example to set exact permissions to read and write for `myfile.txt` for the user and read-only for group and others, you'd use `chmod u=rw,go=r myfile.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can set permissions using numeric mode (also known as octal mode), which uses a three-digit number. The digits are the sum of: 4 for \"read\", 2 for \"write\", and 1 for \"execute\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to set read, write, execute permissions for the owner, read and execute permissions for the group, and read-only for others, you'd use `chmod 754 filename`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Permissions in Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows uses a more complex *Access Control List* (ACL) system. In addition to basic read, write, and execute permissions, ACLs allow for more granular control over file permissions, including permissions for specific actions like deletion, and can specify permissions for individual users and groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore harder to give a complete account of the possibilities, but for every file or folder, there is an ACL, which consists of a series of *Access Control Entries* (ACE), each of which describes a set of permissions for that object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Types of permissions in the ACL system include:\n",
    "- **Full control (F):** The user can read, write, execute, and change permissions on the file or directory\n",
    "- **Modify (M):** The user can read, write, and execute the file or directory, but cannot change its permissions\n",
    "- **Read & execute (RX):** The user can read and run the file or directory, but cannot modify it\n",
    "- **Read (R):** The user can only read the file or directory\n",
    "- **Write (W):** The user can write to the file or directory, but cannot read it\n",
    "- **Special permissions:** These include more granular control like delete, change owner, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows file permissions can be modified via the GUI (right-click on a file or folder, select **Properties**, then **Security**), or via the command line using the `icalcs` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "To display the permissions for an object (ie. a file or folder):\n",
    "\n",
    "`icalcs path/to/folder`\n",
    "\n",
    "To update the permissions, for example to set the file to `Full` for the user `user_1`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`icalcs path/to/folder user_1:(F)`\n",
    "\n",
    "To recursively give permissions to all subfolders in a directory, the `/T` option can be appended."

    "## Writing Text to a File \n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic form of editing that you might want to do in the CLI is to write some text directly to a file from the CLI. \n",
    "\n",
    "On Unix systems, this is accomplished with the `echo` command, and the `>` operator. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`echo Hello, world! > hello.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `>` operator will overwrite whatever is currently in the file if the filename you specify already exists, and create a new file if it does not already exist. To append text to a file that already exists, use the `>>` operator instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Windows Powershell equivalent of `echo` is called `Write-Output`, but you can also use the same syntax as Unix systems, thanks to default aliases. "
