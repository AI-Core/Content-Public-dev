# Command Line Interface

## Setup

### What do I need open?

- Terminal
  - Make sure you clear the output of your terminal before starting
  - Check if when opening the terminal, it executes `bashrc` or `bash_profile`

## Script

- Today, computers are very easy to use.
- they display everything with intuitive colors, icons, and layouts
- but under the hood, what's happening?
- what's happening when you move your mouse, open a browser, change your background, or move some files around?
- of course, your interactions are causing some code to run
- that code then updates the display
- and that code is really just a bunch of files
  - some of those files run when your computer turns on
    - they might do something like display your applications along the bottom of the screen
    - or display the login screen
  - some of them run when you take particular actions like rename files
- that's how everything on the computer works
  - you interact with something using the visual display, and some code runs
- we call that visual display the _graphical user interface_ or _GUI_ sometimes pronounced goo-ey
- the graphical user interface is just a layer on top of the code which is running that makes things look pretty
- we don't have to interact with our computer through the pretty GUI though
  - we can also run the code directly
- and we do that using the _command line interface_, or _CLI_
- the command line interface is a way to talk directly control the computer, without having to use the graphical user interface
- why would you want to do this?

  - graphical user interfaces are much more prone to human error compared to exact lines of text
  - in systems that need to run automatically, there isn't going to be a human
  - some popular applications widely used in industry, like git or airflow, don't have graphical user interfaces
    - in the case of other software, like docker or mlflow, the graphical user interfaces don't give you access to the complete functionality

- we call it the command line, because it provides a line where you can write text to send commands to the machine
- it is also known as the terminal, or the shell

- In this video, we are going to get familiar with the basic terminal commands
- before we get started...

- if you're on windows, and are serious about learning to develop software, stop now and install ubuntu linux
- windows is not an industry standard OS for software development
- it will cause you to face serious issues with installing certain software later on
- the windows terminal will not work in the same way that I am about to explain either

- now let's jump into it...

## Opening the terminal

_switch scene to Screen capture_

- First of all, we need to open the terminal
- just search for terminal and it should come up

_Search for `terminal` and open it_

- once in our terminal, we can see our _command prompt_
- this is where we write commands which the machine will run
- these commands are code
- although they are all similar, different terminals understand different commands
- that's because they run different programming languages
- the most common shell is bash
- zsh is another very common one

- one of the first things that is important to understand is that the terminal is open in a particular location in your files
- if you're not in the same folder, you wont see files you're looking for
- you can see where you are by running the `pwd` command, which is short for print working directory

_Run `pwd`_

- directory is just another word for folder

- when I say _run a command_ I simply mean hit enter
- So we can see that I am currently in `<your current dir>`
- We can list the items we have in this directory using the `ls` command, which is short for List
- We can see the files and folders I have in this directory
- commands can also take in parameters, which we also call arguments
- for example, I know that the first argument to the ls command can be a folder that we want to list the contents of

_Run `ls Desktop`_

- This will show the contents not of my current folder, but of the location I specified

## Command format

- All commands take this form where spaces separate commands and parameters
- this is why folder and file names shouldn't include spaces
- if they do, you can write the location within quotes

- You can also add flags to the command you use.
- a flag is an option you set to the command
- For example, you can tell the command to show you All the items, including the hidden ones
- hidden files or directories are those whose names start with a dot
- they won't show up in a graphical file explorer
- To do so, you have to use the "dash `a`" flag

_Run `ls -a`_

_Switch to side camera_:

- Please, for consistency
- Don't call this dash a minus or a hyphen
- Call it a dash
- You'll also save yourself syllables

_Switch to screen capture_

_Run `ls -a`_

- Now the output includes all of the hidden files and folders

## Hidden folders and files

- What is `.` and `..`?
- These are really important.
- You will find them in essentially every folder
- `.` represents the directory itself, which you are listing the contents of
- `..` represents the directory that contains that directory, one level above it in the file system, known as it's parent directory
- the `l` flag for the `ls` will show the contents in "long format", displaying more specific info such as the permissions, size, and last modified date

## Short vs long flags

- These single character flags I've just showed are known as _short flags_
- They are often the first letter of a corresponding _long flag_
- The corresponding long form flag for the a flag might be "dash dash all"
- The KEY difference here is the use of 2 dashes instead of 1

_Write `ls --all`_

- In reality though the ls command doesn't actually have any long flags, but many commands do

_Run `ls --all`_

- So when I run this it tells me that's an illegal option

- You can often combine short flags by putting their characters directly together
- For example `ls -al` will get you all items in long format
- Pay attention to the difference between combined short flags
- long flags which have a double dash which tells the machine to read the characters together as one word, rather than individually as different short flags

- Of course, you can also combine flags and arguments
- So you can check the list of ALL the elements in Desktop **`[write ls -a Desktop]`**

- And this returns a list of the items with their content permissions, owner, size of the item, and the last modified date.

- With these examples you can start to see a pattern on how to use commands
- The command you use can have flags and arguments
- The syntax would be like this **`[Write "command [flags] [arguments]"]`**
- The command is followed by flags
- And then by arguments
- each of these are separated by spaces

- You can check the flags and arguments of a command in it's _manual_ by using the `man` command followed by the name of the command you want to get help with

_Run `man ls`_

- For example, let's see the options you can use with the `ls` command `man ls`
- The manual pops up and we can see the...
  - description
  - usage
  - and the list of the flags with explanations
- often, the arguments and flags are optional, and you can tell that from the square brackets around them
- You can exit the manual pressing "q" as in quit
- Not all commands have a man page, if they don't you can try and run them with the `--help` flag which usually shows the manual.

_Run `python --help`_

## Other quick tricks

- Here are some other quick things you should be aware of
  - Some commands can take multiple arguments, which come one after another separated by spaces, for example specifying what file to move and where to move it

\_Run `mv myfile.txt new_folder/myfile.txt`

    - Some flags are not just on/off like the -a flag. Some of them take arguments
        - in this case you just leave a space after the flag then specify the argument to that flag
        - or put an = sign between the flag and the value

_Switch to webcam_

- If you can't understand the manual, or just don't know the name of the command, you should just look it up!
- I'm constantly looking them up, and you should be too.
- let me show you how to do that now

_Switch to screen capture_

_Look up "bash how to change folder"_

- We can use the `cd` command, which stands for change directory

_Run `cd <some folder>`_

- By default, most terminals show your current working directory in the command prompt
- Now I've moved to that folder.
  - I can prove that by running `pwd` to print my current working directory

_Run `pwd`_

- But why does the output of pwd look so long? I didn't have to write all of that out to move to this folder
- We just used what is called a _relative path_ to indicate the location of the folder we wanted to move to, relative to our working directory
- On the other hand, `pwd` returns you what is called an _absolute path_.
- That's the location relative to the very top of your file system.
- The absolute path shows every folder separated by a forward slash
- So the folder is within `<parent folder name>` which is within `<grandparent folder name>` and so on
- Relative paths can also include folders nested within each other separated by slashes, but they don't show every folder all the way up the file system
- The very top of your file system is called the root.
- It contains all of the memory on your computer.
- and it's represented by a single `/` as it's filepath

- So if I run `cd /`

_Run `cd /`_

_Run `pwd`_

- I will move to the root folder

_Run `ls`_

- Here, you will find a lot of stuff that you shouldn't touch, including files that run the operating system, and files that run applications you've installed

- To get back to somewhere nice and safe, we can run `cd` with no arguments

_Run `cd`_

- This takes you to what is called your home directory
- In here is just stuff that is to do with your user profile
- The home directory is the default place that your terminal will open up in
- Similarly to how some other key locations are represented by a symbol,
  - like the root is represented by a forward slash
  - the parent, dot dot
- the home directory is represented by a tilde, which is the litle wave
- so `cd` is the same as `cd ~`

_Run `cd ~`_

- It's key to remember that the parent directory is represented by a dot dot, becuase without that you cant move back up

## Tab completion and the up/down keys

- Here's 2 other important tricks for using the terminal

1. You can hit the tab button to fill in the rest of a path or command if there is only one possible option
2. If you want to run a command again, just hit the up key to see your previous commands as many times as you need to

## GUI vs CLI

- Take a second to remember that everything we've just shown is possible using the graphical interface too
  - Looking at your current folder
  - Showing folder contents
  - Moving around folders
- I know you know exactly how to do all of that stuff using the GUI, and now you know how to do it using the CLI

## Outro

- So these are the basic commands to navigate through our directories and explore them
