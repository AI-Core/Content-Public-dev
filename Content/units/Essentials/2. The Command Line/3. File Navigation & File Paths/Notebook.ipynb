    "## File Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "> The term *file path* refers to the specific location of a file or a directory in the file system. It provides a way to navigate through the hierarchical structure of a computer's file system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a file path:\n",
    "\n",
    "`/home/user/documents/my_textfile.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "It is composed of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Root Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "The root directory is the base directory of your file system. In Unix-like systems, this is typically represented by a forward slash (`/`). In Windows, it's typically represented by a drive letter followed by a colon and a backslash, eg. `C:\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Directories and Subdirectories\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the folders within the file system. Each folder is separated by a slash (`/`) in Unix-like systems or a backslash (`\\`) in Windows. \n",
    "\n",
    "> In general, the term *parent directory* or `parent folder` is used to mean the directory above the current directory, and *child directory* or *subdirectory* are used to describe a folder inside the current folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "> A set of folders inside each other are said to be *nested*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in `/home/user/documents`, `home`, `user`, and `documents` are directories, each nested inside the previous one. `home` is the parent of `user`, and `documents` is the child of `user`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. File Name\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the name of the file at the end of the file path. For instance, in `/home/user/documents/my_textfile.txt`, `my_textfile.txt` is the file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.File Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the part of the file name after the last dot, which typically indicates the file type. In `my_textfile.txt`, `txt` is the file extension, in this case indicating that it's a text file. Don't worry about not knowing much about file types now, we will cover them later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `~` Shortcut\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Unix-like operating systems, the tilde (`~`) character is a shortcut that represents the home directory of the current user. This is usually a directory named after the user under the `/home` directory in Linux, or in `/Users` on a Mac.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you have a user named `user1`, typing `cd ~` or simply `cd` will change the working directory to `/home/user1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also access other users' home directories using the tilde as well. If you have a user named `user2`, `~user2` would refer to the home directory of `user2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This usage of the tilde to represent the home directory is a feature provided by the shell, and not the underlying filesystem or operating system. This means that it might not be recognized in all contexts outside of a shell command line, such as in a programming language that interacts with the filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Filepaths Containing Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The space character in terminal commands is used to separate arguments to a command, so for this reason, spaces in directory names can cause issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the directory name `~/Important Documents` would be read as two arguments \"Important\" and \"Documents\". It is therefore best practice to avoid using spaces in directory names, and instead use a `_` or `-` character to separate words. \n",
    "\n",
    "> If you do have spaces in your directory names though, you can enclose them in single (`'`) or double (`\"`) quotes on Windows, or use backslash (`\\`) before the empty space in Unix-based systems to avoid the issue."

For instance, `mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3` will create `dir1`, `dir2` inside `dir1`, and `dir3` inside `dir2`. Without the `-p` option, this command would fail if `dir1` or `dir2` did not already exist. \n",

There are some tools that might be able to recover your data, but this is well beyond the scope of normal command line function. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Windows Powershell\n",
