# File manipulation

_Switch to webcam_

- You can use the terminal to create, read, update, or delete files
- As I demonstrate this, I'm going to show you the terminal and the graphical file explorer side by side to highlight what's happenin

## Creating files and directories
_Switch to screen capture with terminal on left and file explorer on right, open in same location_

- You can create directories using the `mkdir` command, which is short for for make directory
- it takes the name of the directory to create as an argument

_Run mkdir `myfolder`_

- You can see a new folder has been created

_Point to the folder in the file explorer and open it_

- Let's move inside in the terminal too

_Run `cd myfolder`_

- To create an empty file, you can use the command `touch` followed by the name of the file you want to create

- This command isn't designed for creating files
- It is called touch because it updates the last edited time of a file, as if you'd touched it to brush the dust off
- But it creates the file if it doesn't exist, so it can be used for that too

_Run `touch myfile.txt`_

- You can see that a text file has been created in this directory


## Updating files: Editing
- To edit a file, you can use what is called a _text editor_
- Such as `nano` or `vim`. 
- And I will give you extra points if you use Vim
- but it is more complicated to use, so for this example we are going to use nano
- So, let's run `nano myfile.txt` 
<!-- TODO add link to vim demo in video or content page -->
_Run `nano myfile.txt`_

- This opens a new window that allows us to modify the file 
- Let's write some text

_Write "Hello World" into the file_

- Once we are happy, you can press Ctrl + O to save the changes, and then Ctrl + X to exit the editor

## Reading files
- To read the content of a file you can use the `cat` command followed by the file you want to look at
- So let's take a look 
_Run `cat myfile.txt`_
- And you can see the output contains the contents of the file
- Let's create another directory inside this one __`[RUN "mkdir child_folder"]`__

## Updating files: Moving

_Show how to look up how to move a file by searching `bash move file`_

- We can move a file to another directory using the `mv` command
    - So, to move the `myfile.txt` to the `child_folder` directory we can run `mv myfile.txt child_folder`
- You can see that the file has moved in the file explorer__`
- Let's move inside the child_folder. 
- Remember to tab complete

_Run `cd child_folder` using tab completion`

_Run `ls`_

- Now we can see the moved file in both the CLI and the GUI


## Updating/Creating files: Copying
- In addition to moving a file, we can also copy a file using the `cp` command
    - let's copy `myfile.txt` in the parent directory by typing `cp myfile.txt ..`
    - In the window on the right-hand side we can see that `myfile.txt` has appeared
    - But __`[Open child_folder]`__ the original file is still there, meaning that certainly, we created a copy
- Let's move to the parent directory to see how to delete files __`[RUN cd ..]`__


## Deleting files
- You can delete a file using `rm` as in remove.
    - So, to delete `myfile.txt` you can run `rm myfile.txt` __`[RUN rm myfile.txt]`__
    - And we can see that the file has been removed
- You can also remove directories using the same command. Let's try that out __`[RUN rm child_folder]`__
- Apparently, child_folder can't be removed that easily because it is a directory
- We can add the flag -r to `rm` that Recursively removes elements
    - So, let's run `rm -r child_folder` __`[RUN "rm -r child_folder"]`__

## Updating files: Redirection
- One basic thing I haven't mentioned yet is that you can run commands that will print something to the output
- To do this, you can use the `echo` command followed by what you want to print out

_Run `echo "Hello World"`_

- To understand how it works, we have to know that there are three main channels of information between the terminal and the process which it is running on the processor
    1. The standard input channel takes in the input from us, for example, through the terminal prompt
    2. The stardard output channel exposes messages from the process, by default printing them to the terminal
    3. And the standard error channel exposes error messages from the process in case something goes wrong
- So, if everything works fine, the `echo` command will expose the message through the standard output channel
    - But we can redirect the message from the standard output to  a file instead
    - We can use the right angled bracket between an expected output and a filename

_Run `echo "Hello" > newfile.txt`_ 

- So, if we run `echo "Hello" > newfile.txt` the output is not displayed, but it will go to a file named `newfile.txt`
- Using a single greater than sign will create a new file
- Let's check how it works
    - First, let's see the content of `newfile.txt` by running `cat newfile.txt`

_Run `cat newfile.txt`

- Now, let's run another echo command with a redirection and a different sentence

_Run `echo "Goodbye" > newfile.txt`_

_Run `cat newfile.txt`_

- We can see the new content 
- We can see that the content has been overwritten
- If we want to append to, rather than overwrite an existing file we can use two right angled brackets as such

_Run `echo "Hello again" >> newfile.txt`_
    
_Run `cat newfile.txt`

- A final little trick here is to run the `clear` command to clear the terminal up
