# A deeper understanding of the terminal
- Now you know the basics, you can start doing some more advanced stuff to increase your productivity

- One thing you can do is define shorthands for longer commands
- We call these aliases
- Aliases are useful for commands that you find yourself reusing again and again, especially when they are long to type out

- Let's say that you want to create a log of notes from the terminal
- you could do that by echoing the note and redirecting it into a file by running the command `echo "My note" > ~/notes.txt`

_Run `echo "My note" > ~/notes.txt`_

- But that's a bit long
- So let me create an aliase for that
- You can do it by running `alias note='echo "My note" > ~/notes.txt'`
    - Notice that because i didn't want any confusion between which quote marks match, i used different types of quotes
    - And now, if you type `note` my terminal will add  you will move to the parent directory
- Unfortunately at the moment, it's going to add the same note every time. 
- So let's tackle that

<!-- TODO demo looking it up -->
- In bash, you can access the variables passed into a command with a dollar sign followed by the index of the variable
- So if I write `alias note="echo $1"`

_Run `alias note="echo $1"`_

_Run `note yo`_

- You see that it echos the first argument passed to my newly defined `note` command
- Let's update our alias so that it redirects that note into a file

_Run `alias note="echo $1 >> ~/notes.txt"`_

- With this, I'm telling my note command to echo the first argument, then redirect it (appending, not overwriting) into a file called notes.txt within my home directory

- Nice

- But another problem with this is that these aliases won't persist after you close this terminal


- So, how can we get around that?
- Firstly, you need to know that when you open the terminal, it will automatically run a particular file

_Switch to screen capture_

- By default, a bash terminal executes the `.bashrc` in your home directory

_Run `ls -a` in home directory and show .bashrc_

- notice that it starts with a dot, which means it's a hidden file, so it won't show up in the graphical file explorer or without the dash `a` flag on ls

<!-- TODO when does it run bashprofile? -->
<!-- . However, if you have configured your terminal to need your profile, it will execute `~/.bash_profile` -->
- So, let's modify this file to make it greet us when we start a terminal
- Let's edit our `.bashrc` file and add our alias

_Edit the `.bashrc` and add a line `alias note="echo $1 >> ~/notes.txt"`


- Because every line in this file is run upon opening a new terminal, adding aliases to the `bashrc` means they will persist for new terminals

- Now, if we close and open the terminal, we can still use our notes app

_Open the terminal and re-run the previous command to save a note_

## Env variables
- Editing the bashrc is also useful for anything that you want to happen every time you open a terminal

- One of the things that I often use it for is setting variables

- We call these variables which are set as part of the environment which the terminal uses, _environment variables_, and they conventionally have uppercase names
- In bash you can access variables defined in your working environment by writing their name after a dollar sign
    - the dollar sign tells bash to evaluate the variable, rather than use what is literally written

- Some of the environment variables that I think are worth noting are 
1. PATH
    - Shows you all the places where bash will look for commands it can run, which are known as executables, separated by colons
2. PYTHONPATH
    - Shows you all the places where the programming language Python will look for liraries it can import, separated by colons
3. HOME
    - Is the absolute path of your home directory, which somewhere, the tilde character is defined as an alias for

_One by one echo the value of each_

- Some other industry software like Spark, MLFlow and Kafka require you to correctly set environment variables

## Package managers

- Everything that I've shown so far is builtin to the terminal, meaning it's installed and works by default
- I'm sure you can imagine though, that it would be useful to install more code written by other people
- To do that you need to use a package manager
- There are different package managers for installing code written in different languages
    - For example, we would use a python package manager to install 3rd parth python code
- but for 3rd parth terminal software we use a system package manager
- if you're on linux, your package manager should be `apt` (that's APT)

_Type `apt` in terminal_

- if you're on Mac, it should be `brew`, 

_Type `brew` in terminal_

- and you can easily install it by searching it and then running the command provided
    
_Quickly show searching online `download brew`, copying the command and then running it_
    
- And if you're on windows...

_Switch to side camera and shake head jokingly_

- You shouldn't still be on windows

_Switch to webcam_

- So let's have a go at install a nice little 3rd party software with the system package manager

_Run `brew install tree`_

- You might get a permission error
- These are often implemented not just for security, but to prevent you from doing anything silly, like deleting part of the operating system
- So now I need to tell you about `sudo`
- `sudo` is a command which takes in a complete other command, arguments and all, and runs it with admin permissions
- We often call the role with these elevated permisssions the super-user, which is where the name `sudo` comes from, being short for "super user do..."
- So let's sudo our install

_Run `sudo brew install tree`_

- note that, of course to run sudo you must have admin access to your machine, so if it's someone elses computer or a work computer, you might not be able to run sudo
