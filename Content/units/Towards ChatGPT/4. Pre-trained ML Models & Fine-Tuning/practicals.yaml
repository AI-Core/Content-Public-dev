    1. Install Huggingface transformers.
    2. create a new python file called `sentiment_pipeline.py`
    3. import the `pipeline` class from `transformers`.
    4. create an instance of the pipeline, passing it the argument “sentiment-analysis” to load the default sentiment analysis model.
    5. Create some data to analyse. This should be in the form of a list, where each element is a phrase. Try some positive ones (“you're awesome!”), negative ones (left to your imagination), and neutral ones.
    6. Call the pipeline instance on the data, and  print the output. 
    7. Try changing the pipeline to use a different model from the transformers library. You can find more sentiment anaylsis options in the huggingface docs.
