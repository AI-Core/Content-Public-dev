    "# General CV Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Donâ€™t include a display picture - even unconscious biases can play against your CV\n",
    "- Keep it simple\n",
    "- Keep a master CV \n",
    "- Keep it concise: Your CV should be no longer than two pages, and ideally one page if possible. Use bullet points and clear headings to make your CV easy to read.\n",
    "- Use clear formatting: Use a simple, professional font and a clear, easy-to-read format. Avoid using flashy colors or graphics that may distract from the content.\n",
    "- Include relevant information: Your CV should include your name and contact information, work experience, education, skills, and any relevant certifications or awards.\n",
    "- Highlight your achievements: Use concrete examples and achievements to demonstrate your skills and experience. This can help to differentiate you from other applicants and demonstrate your value.\n",
    "- Proofread and edit: Before submitting your CV, proofread it carefully and ask a friend or mentor to review it for errors or inconsistencies.\n",
    "- Remember, your CV is often the first impression you make on potential employers, so it's important to take the time to create a strong, professional document that showcases your skills and experience.\n"
