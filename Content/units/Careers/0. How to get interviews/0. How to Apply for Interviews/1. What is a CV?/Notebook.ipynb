    "Before we get into the most important details, hereâ€™s the basic definition of CV\n",
    "\n",
    "> The point of a CV is to showcase your qualifications and demonstrate why you are a strong candidate for the position.\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying for a job in tech, a CV can help you stand out from other applicants by highlighting your technical skills and experience. It can also provide details on your past projects, programming languages you're proficient in, and other technical abilities you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a well-written CV can show potential employers that you are organised, detail-oriented, and able to communicate effectively. In the tech industry, these qualities are highly valued as they are essential for successful project completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, a CV is an essential part of the job application process in tech, as it can help you showcase your qualifications and secure the job you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro Tip: Employers use CVs to filter out unsuitable applicants\n",
    "\n",
    "CVs are often used as a filter by employers to help them quickly and efficiently screen job applicants. A CV provides a snapshot of an applicant's education, work experience, and skills, which allows employers to quickly assess whether a candidate meets the requirements for a particular job. Employers use specific criteria, such as education level, years of experience, and technical skills, to screen CVs and identify applicants who are a good match for the position. In this way, CVs help employers filter out candidates who do not meet the minimum qualifications or are not a good fit for the role. A well-crafted CV can increase the likelihood of being selected for an interview and moving on to the next stage of the hiring process."
