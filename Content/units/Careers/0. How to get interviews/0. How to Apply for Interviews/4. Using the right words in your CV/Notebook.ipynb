    "# Using the right words in your CV\n",
    "\n",
    "Action verbs and power words are essential elements of an effective resume. These words help to convey your skills, accomplishments, and experience in a clear and concise manner. Action verbs are words that describe an action or achievement, such as \"managed,\" \"created,\" or \"improved.\" Power words, on the other hand, are descriptive words that add impact and emphasize your strengths, such as \"dynamic,\" \"innovative,\" or \"results-driven.\" Using action verbs and power words in your resume can make it stand out from the rest and help you to showcase your potential to employers. It's important to choose the right action verbs and power words that match your skills and experience and to use them strategically throughout your resume.\n",
