    "### Here are the top 5 mistakes that people tend to make in interviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Not preparing enough: Many candidates don't do enough research on the company or the position, don't practice common interview questions, and fail to prepare examples of their skills and experience. It's important to thoroughly prepare for the interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Being late or unprepared: Showing up late or forgetting to bring important materials like your resume or work samples can make a bad impression on the interviewer. Be sure to arrive on time and bring everything you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Poor body language: Your body language can say a lot about you during an interview. Avoid slouching, fidgeting, or crossing your arms, as these behaviors can make you seem disinterested or unconfident.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Not answering questions fully: Listen carefully to the interviewer's questions and answer them fully. Avoid giving short answers or straying off topic. Use specific examples to illustrate your responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Speaking negatively about previous employers: Criticizing past employers, colleagues, or managers during the interview can reflect poorly on you. Instead, focus on the positive experiences and skills you've gained in previous roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "By being aware of these common mistakes and taking steps to avoid them, you can improve your chances of acing your next job interview. Good luck!\n"
