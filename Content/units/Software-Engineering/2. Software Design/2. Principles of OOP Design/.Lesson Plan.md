# Principles of OOP Design

- Clean code is crucial for a project
- It allows teammates to communicate better
- It improves readability
- It allows using the same algorithm with different parameters
- Prevents bugs caused by extensive codes
- Increase the flexibility of your code

- Concern: A piece of code that is responsible for a tangible task
- Scope: Several programming languages take advantage of scope for avoiding name collisions and unpredictable behaviors. Most commonly, youâ€™ll distinguish two general scopes:
    - Global. 
    - Local. 
- Namespaces:
    - Namespace and import statement

- Concerns can be separated according to their specific tasks
- At the same time, tasks should include a single concerns
- [DEMO] We take the webscraper and separate it into several functions

- Often, functions are related to other, they share outputs and inputs, and putting everything into a class makes it much cleaner, readable and flexible
- [DEMO] Show how to put functions into a class
- [DEMO] be careful how you show it, self is quite tricky sometimes, so make sure to explain everything very slowly
