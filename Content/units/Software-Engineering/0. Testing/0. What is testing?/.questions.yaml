questions:
  - question: What is the main difference between Functional and Non-Functional Testing?
  - question: Give me two real world examples of wanting to use performance testing
  - question: You have a webscraper that extracts data using multiple functions working in sequence. How would you implement unit testing? How would you implement integration testing?
  - question: For a TestCase class you are defining, you are always using the same example. Instead of repeating the same lines of code in each method, what other method can you use?
  - question: Why would you want to use the tearDown() method?
  - question: You create a test that intentionally causes an error in the function you are testing. What assertion do you have to use?
  - question: How many assertions can you write in a single test?
  - question: Why and how do you implement a strategy using hypothesis?
  - question: "You have the following code:
    \n\n`class Friend`:
    \n\n\tdef __init__(self, name: str):
    \n\n\t\t    self.name = name
    \n\n\tdef go_partying(self):
    \n\n\t\t    return f\"Hey {self.name}, let's get wasted!\"
    \n\n And then this TestCase:
    \n\n `import unittest`
    \n\n `class PartyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):`
    \n\n\t    def setUp(self):
    \n\n\t\t       self.party_person = Friend(victim)
    \n\n\t    def test_party(self):
    \n\n\t\t        expected_value = f\"Hey {self.party_person.name}, let's behave and study Python!\"
    \n\n\t\t        actual_value = self.party_person.go_partying()        
    \n\n `unittest.main(argv=[''], verbosity=0, exit=False)`
    \n\n What is the expected output?"
