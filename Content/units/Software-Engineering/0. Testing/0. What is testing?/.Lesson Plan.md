# 5. Testing

- Why do we need testing?
    - When our program is just a few lines of codes we don't need it, since we can test it directly in the main script
    - As the program starts growing, we need to make sure that the previous functions are still working as initially planned
    - Testing is a thorough and formal process for applications
    - We will start looking at Non-functional testing

- Non functional Testing consists on testing components not directly related to its functionality
    - Performance
    - Security 
    - Compatibility (wrt to other systems)
    - Other techniques:
        - Peer Review
        - Code analyzers
        - Coverage (Check the progress of the testing process)

- Functional Testing:
    - It consists on checking that the code has the same functionality as it was initially planned
    - It can be done manually or automatically
    - Manual testing is usually done for higher levels of granularity:
        - Acceptance and System Testing
    - Automatic Testing is usually performed for lower levels of granularity:
        - Integration and Unit
    - Regressions: You will start adding tests to your test suite as more bugs are found

- Unit Testing:
    - Python offers a built-in testing framework for unit testing called unittest
    - It can also be used for integration testing
    - Tests have to be defined as methods in a TestCase class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`
    - By inheriting from that class, it also inherits many methods like assertions that check if a given condition is given. If that condition is not fulfilled, the test fails
    - [DEMO] Explain the script product.py and start creating ProductTestCase
    - [DEMO] Create a script and run unittest in the CLI
    - [DEMO] Start adding tests to the TestCase class
    - [Challenge]:
    ### Try it yourself (20 min)

        - Try changing the name of the method to something that doesn't contain test at the beginning

            - Add the 'incorrect' function to the `test_product.py` script.
            - Run unittest on the command line <br>
        <br>
        - Go back to the 'right' function and try changing the expected value
            - Add the 'right' function to the `test_product.py` script.
            - Run unittest on the command line<br>
        <br>
        - Change functionality to the `transform_name_for_sku()` method:
            - It will now Capitalize the name of the product instead of UPPERCASING it
            - Run the same test again
            - Observe the errors
            - This will happen every time you make a slight change to your code, and it might be annoying changing the test every time. But imagine what will happen when you start adding more and more code. A slight change can cause a huge snowball effect!<br>
        <br>
        - Add two more test methods:
            - test_transform_color_for_sku, which asserts that the colour is well written after using `transform_color_for_sku()`
            - test_generate_sku, which asserts that the SKU is well written after using `generate_sku()`
            - for both cases, use `Product('shoes', 'S', 'black')`
    
    - Explain how setUp and tearDown work
        - setUp is like `__init__` of tests
        - tearDown is like `__del__` of tests
    
    - By now, they have seen asserts to create some tests
        - Explain that test assertion work the same way as Python `assert`
        - Give a list of possible assertion statements
    
    - [DEMO] Test Suite
        - Explain the cart script
        - Add a new test class to test this script
        - By adding a new class, we are already creating a test suite
        - By adding a new class that calls for two different scripts, we are already creating integration testing
    
    - Hypothesis
        - Hypothesis offers a wide range of possible scenarios that  you can use in your tests
        - Scenarios in this case are named strategies
        - YOu can add one scenario using the `@given` decorator
        - [DEMO] Use Hypothesis to add a range of scenarios to encode and decode
        - You can exclude specific values for your testing scenarios
