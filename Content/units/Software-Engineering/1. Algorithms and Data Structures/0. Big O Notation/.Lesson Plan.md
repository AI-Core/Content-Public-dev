# Big O
- Explain the concept of Big O
    - It is a normalized method
    - Different computers will have different execution times depending on their processor
    - Show the number of operations it will perform, not the operation inside
    - Big O is in essence the complexity in the worst case scenario 
    - What does each notation mean O(n) O(n2)?
    - Ask about O(1)

- [DEMO]: Show the execution time using FIB with loops and with Recursion 


- Space complexity: Inefficient use of disk is often overlooked 

- [DEMO]: Show the generators with getsizeof. Compare their sizes seeing that generators are more efficient

- Explain that there are many complexities: Binary search has log N complexity,
