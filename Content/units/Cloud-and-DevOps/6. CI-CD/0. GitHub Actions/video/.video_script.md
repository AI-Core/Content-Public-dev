# CI/CD & GitHub actions

# Setup

- create a blank github repo called Actions-Demo-Repo

<!-- TODO move definition of CI/CD to another video -->

## Continuous Deployment / Delivery

- Big changes to software can cause unexpected issues as lots of new stuff is introduced at once
- these can be technical issues, like code simply crashing
- or these can be user experience issues, like confusing users who are used to the old way of doing things
- because of that, it's useful to deploy small changes continuously
- we call this continuous deployment, or continuous delivery, or CD for short

## Continuous Integration

- because it's common to have many people working on different parts of a software project, it's easy to introduce issues when you want to combine them
- it's easier to integrate small changes into the main codebase compared to big changes
- we call doing this continuous integration

- Doing something continuously obviously means doing it more frequently
- So tools like github actions have emerged to help automate parts of the workflow

- Such as
  - deploying a new version of software
  - running tests
  - triggering notifications or alerts

## What is Github actions?

- GitHub actions allows you to trigger code which runs, to automate these kind of things, when events like a push to the main branch happens on your github repo

- the code that runs can be configued in the actions tab of a github repo

_Switch to screen capture_

_Show clicking to the actions tab_

- You use workflows which already exist and are published on github
- or you can write your own workflows from scratch

_Show template_

- this template actually does a good job of explaining the configuration parameters of the workflow
- it's written in YAML
- which lives inside a `workflows` folder inside a `.github` folder
- you can call your workflow files whatever you want
- as long as they are in this folder github will try to run them
- you can have as many workflows as you like
- and the free tier gives you access to 2000 minutes of compute
- the compute running these workflows actually happens on github's servers
- but it can be configured to run on your own

- let's look into the configuration of this template
- the first thing we've got is the name of the workflow
- change the name to `My Workflow Name`
<!-- - this shows up runs in the actions tab after it runs  -->

- then we've got the `on` key which specifies which events the workflow runs on
- these keys must be known events that github actions recognises
- here, each event name is a key in a dictionary, and the value is another dictionary which in this case specifies which branches to listen out for that event on

- the values to this on key can either be a list of strings
- You can trigger actions to run on many different kinds of events
- and you can easily find these in the docs

_Search "github actions events" and open docs_

_Find the workflow dispatch event_

- the workflow dispatch creates a button on the actions tab which allows you to trigger the workflow manually

## Jobs

- jobs are parts of the workflow which run in parallel
- each job has a name, which you can choose, and set as a key within the jobs dictionary

_Highlight the build key_

- under that key you can specify the image of the machine that it runs on

- and the steps which run within each job
- steps run synchronously, one after another
- in those steps you can run other actions

_Highlight the step that runs the checkout action_

- actions like this are the username and repo name of a repo which is configured as a github action
- you can check out how to make your own actions in the docs
- this action is one that you see in basically every workflow
- it copies the code in your repo onto the cloud server running the action, as is required in many workflows such as packaging it up and deploying it, or running tests on it

- these other steps show how you can run bash commands

- you can have as many jobs as you want simply by defining them under other keys

## Running the workflow

- this action is going to run on every push to the main branch
- so if i commit this file to that branch...

_Hit commit_

- we should be able to see this workflow running in the actions tab
- you can filter by workflow name from the left

_Filter_

- and when you do that you can see the button which appears as a result of the workflow dispatch key

\_Highlight "Run workflow" button"

- here, you can see the history of previous workflow runs

_Point to the list of workflow runs on the right_

- and in these bubbles you can see each of the jobs that ran as part of that workflow

_Hover over job_

- if you click that job you can see the logs from each step

_Click bubble and expand logs for one step_

- this can be helpful for debugging as typically, testing that a workflow works is usually a case of trying to trigger it and then look here for what broke

- with that, you should be able to get started with github actions
