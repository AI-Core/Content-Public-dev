# API Gateway

## What is API Gateway?
- easy way to make APIs on AWS
- it's called API gateway because it acts as an interface to the applications that can securely sit behind it
    - events are going to be sent to the API in the form of web requests
    - the API is going to handle the traffic management, authentication
    - then it's going to trigger some action on the backend, most usually by forwarding the event to some other AWS service, where it will be handled
- show API gateway landing page and read explanation

## Building our first API
- [DEMO] create an API from the console
    - [EXPLAIN] REST or Websocket or HTTP?
- [DEMO] create an API resource 
    - the resource defines a path on our API which requests can be made to
- [DEMO] on that resource, create a method
    - these methods define what method types the resource can accept
    - when we create any method, we can choose which integration we want on the backend
        - that is, what do we want to happen to the API request next?
    - the default option here is lambda function
    - let's quickly define our lambda function with the code in examples/lambda_function.py
- [EXPLAIN] the 4 parts of a request
    - if you click into them you can see what each part is for
- create a new stage called prod
    - we might have multiple versions of our API: production and dev for example
- [CHALLENGE] create your own API
- [DEMO] dont forget to deploy the API
- when we deploy the API, we're taken to the "Stages" tab
    - this is where our deployed APIs are shown
    - in contrast to the resources tab
- show the invoke URLs generated

## Testing the API from python
- create a new python script

- copy the invoke URL and put it

## Testing the API using Postman
