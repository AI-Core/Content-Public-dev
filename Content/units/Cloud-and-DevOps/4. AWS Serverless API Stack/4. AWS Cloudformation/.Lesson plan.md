## AWS Cloudformation
- cloudformation is a service that uses YAML templates to provision AWS infrastructure
- this allows us to define our entire stack, and how each piece interoperates with each other, in code!
- we specify our entire stack in a template.yaml file
- [SHOW] examples/template.yaml
- in this introductory template, we just have 3 keys at the top level of our template
    - "template version" specifies the version of template you are using so AWS interprets it correctly
        - developers might change the specification to improve the product over time
    - "Description" simply gives a description to the stack
    - "resources" defines what AWS resources the stack consists of
        - we'll look further into how the resources are defined shortly, but for now
        - we can see that the stack only contains a single S3 bucket
- from a template, we can simply use the AWS CLI to deploy the stack
    - `aws cloudformation deploy --template-file template.yaml --stack-name demo-stack`
- let's now check out the cloudformation console
    - https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-west-1#/stacks?filteringStatus=active&filteringText=&viewNested=true&hideStacks=false
    - click into the stack
        - here we can see basic information such as 
            - whether the latest creation failed of succeeded
            - when it was last deployed
    - click to the resources tab
        - here we can see the resouces that the stack consists of
    - we can also get an automatically generated visualisation using the Cloudformation "designer"
- [ASK] why might we want to do this?
    - if you have several different stacks in one company, it's confusing which AWS resources are running on your account belong to which part of your project
    - eliminate human error in configuring resources manually
    - infrastructure design can go through some code-review process like other code can
    - removing lots of resources which can be part of a large stack might be very tiresome
        - when we delete a cloudformation stack, it deletes all of the component resources

## More on templates
- the keys which are direct children of the "Resources" key are unique identifiers for each resource.
    - we call this the logical id
    - if we change this identifier, we'll be referencing a different resource
- we can see the full template reference here
    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html

## Let's try to create the application we made yesterday in cloudformation
- lambda function which periodically gets data from stackoverflow by API request
- let's start by copying our demo s3 bucket application and changing the name of the bucket
- let's now add a lambda function resource
    - open the lambda docs from the template reference
    - define a simple hello world lambda function code
- to get around this, we should update the stack rather than recreate it
    - we should create a "change-set" which specifies the updates to be made to our stack
    - this shows us which changes will take place when the stack is updated
    - this helps prevent you from:
        - deleting critical resources like S3 buckets containing data
        - letting critical services like EC2 servers go down
    - then we can execute those changes
    - let's do this from the console
- now let's check out the stack's resources
    - we should be able to see the lambda function
    - click into it
    - you can see it has a somewhat random name
    - we can also see that it has a banner telling us that this resource is part of a stack
- we'll need to reference the name of our bucket
    - some variables might either be annoying to hard code everywhere when they change
        - like the name of a bucket
    - or might not be available until runtime
        - like a resource ARN
    - cloudformation provides what are called "intrinsic functions" which help us to do this
        - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference.html
    - we can use those to access values which might depend on the stack itself
    - we can reference other resources in our cloudformation stack using `Ref`
        - [SHOW] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-ref.html
        - when you give it a resource's logical name, `!Ref` gets you the physical id (like the name of your bucket or lambda function)
        - let's add this environment variable and redeploy our stack
        - check the lambda function now has the correct bucket name
- 

## 
- When stack creation fails, the stack will try to roll back, but there's no previous stack state to roll back to, so it will fail
- in this case, you need to delete the stack and recreate it
