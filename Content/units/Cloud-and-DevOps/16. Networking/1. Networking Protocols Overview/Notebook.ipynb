Once it reaches the receiving device, the headers are removed from the data by each layer in reverse order to which they were applied.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    `SELECT * FROM product` <br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. The application (in this case the PostgresQL) will use the PostgresQL protocol to add it’s header to the user data. The application header will include metadata that will be required by the PostgresQL protocol on the receiving device to handle the user data on arrival. Together the user data and application header form the Application Data, which is passed to the Transport layer. <br><br>\n",
    "3. The Transport layer protocol in this case is TCP. It will split the data into segments, based on the largest size of packet that can be transmitted by the network access layer. It will add its own header to each segment of the data, which will include the source and destination ports, error checking data and sequencing information. Information wrapped in this way is called a TCP segment and contains the information needed for the receiving machine’s TCP protocol to handle the message once it arrives.<br><br>\n",
    "4. The TCP segment is then passed to the Internet layer, where the IP protocol adds its own header to create an IP packet. Segment size generally chosen so that each segment forms a single packet. The details of how IP works will be covered in a future lesson, but the header contains information on which machine on the internet the packet should be sent to, and the route it should take to get there.<br><br>\n",
    "5. Finally the IP packet is passed to the Network Access Layer, where the ethernet protocol adds a header and footer to the packet, creating what is known as a frame. The header and footer contain information on the source and destination MAC addresses, information on what the packet contains, and error checking to ensure the frame that is sent is the same as the one that is received."

If the receiving machine is on a different network, the frame will be addressed to the router that connects the local network to the internet on the first hop. <br><br>\n",
    "2. Upon receiving the frame, the router examines the Ethernet frame, strips off the Ethernet header, and examines the IP packet. It uses the destination IP address from the IP header to determine where to send the packet, and which route to use to get there.<br><br>\n",
    "3. The router then encapsulates the IP packet in a new Ethernet frame (or appropriate frame for the next network segment), with the new Ethernet header specifying the router's MAC address as the source and the next hop's MAC address as the destination.<br><br>\n",
    "4. There may be several similar hops in the message’s journey across the internet before it reaches the destination network, with each router along the path examining the IP packet, determining the next hop, and re-encapsulating the message into a new frame. <br><br>\n",
    "5. On arrival at the receiving machine, the headers are stripped off in the reverse order, with each protocol determining where the message should be sent until it eventually reaches the PostgresQL protocol, which determines what to do with the original query.<br><br>"
