    "## Security Groups\n",
    ">*Security Groups* are collections of rules which control the network traffic in and out of the **resources** they are associated with. Security Groups operate by managing what connections can be made to a resource. This means that Security Groups are stateful, since if a connection is allowed, it will continue to exist bidirectionally until it is closed. In other words, security groups retain the state of a connection throughout the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the important characteristics of Security Groups you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Default Security Groups:** When you create a VPC, a Security Group is created by default, which is set to allow all traffic out of the resources it is associated with and only traffic in from the Security Group itself \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traffic Rules:** Security Groups are designed to permit traffic; they cannot explicitly deny traffic. Instead, any traffic that is not expressly allowed by any rule is implicitly denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Security Groups exist separately from their associated resources, so you can modify rules without needing to re-provision the resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Resource Scope:** Security Groups can be associated with multiple resources at once, meaning you can modify security rules which then affect many resources\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Group Rules\n",
    "Security Group rules are created as either inbound or outbound rules, where inbound traffic comes from an external source to the instance, and outbound traffic comes from the instance to an external destination. Each rule specifies the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type:** The type of traffic (or more specifically, the protocol) you want to allow in or out of your instance. Some common protocol options are listed as options in the dropdown (for example SSH, Postgres, HTTP), but you can also select Custom TCP\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Protocol:** This will be greyed out and filled in for you, unless you select *Custom Protocol* in the Type dropdown list, in which case you can manually type the protocol yourself\n",
    "- **Port range:** A specific port number or range of port numbers traffic is allowed to access. Again this might be auto-populated depending on what traffic type you chose. \n",
    "- **Source/Destination:** For inbound rules, the source of the traffic. For outbound rules, the destination where you want the traffic to go. This can be either your own IP address, any IP address, a custom IP address which you then enter in the next box, another Security Group, or specific AWS services\n",
    "- **Description:** An optional description of what the rule is and why it is there"
