    "### Security Groups\n",
    ">*Security Groups* are collections of rules which control the network traffic in and out of the **instances** they are associated with, such as EC2 or RDS instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the important characteristics of Security Groups you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you create a VPC, a Security Group is created by default, which is set to allow all traffic in and out of the instances it is associated with\n",
    "\n",
    "- They can only be made to allow traffic in or out of an instance, not deny\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are *stateful*, which means if a request is allowed out by a particular rule, then the corresponding response is automatically allowed access as well\n",
    "\n",
    "### NACLs (Network Access Control Lists)\n",
    ">*NACLs* are collections of rules which control the network traffic in and out of the **subnets** they are associated with.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the important characteristics of NACLs you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each subnet must be associated with one NACL. New subnets get a default NACL, which accepts all inbound and outbound traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- NACLs can be customised to allow or deny traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "- NACL rules are numbered. Rules are evaluated in order of their rule number, so lower numbers get a higher precedence. For example, traffic will be allowed in to an instance if there is a rule of number 100 which allows it, even if there is another rule of number 200 which denies it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- They are *stateless*, which means that every request and response in and out of a subnet is checked against the rules exclusively\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NACLs and Ephemeral Ports\n",
    "For an instance and a target to establish a connection they must use ports: the instance connects to a *defined port* on the target, and expects a response on an *ephemeral port*. This is important to remember when creating NACL rules, since NACLs are stateless. \n",
    "\n",
    "When creating rules for inbound traffic we need to open the required ephemeral port range so that a response can be received by the instance. The port range varies depending on the instance's operating system: Linux machines use 32768-61000, most recent Windows versions use 49152-65535, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Group and NACL Rules\n",
    "Security Group and NACL rules are created as either inbound or outbound rules, specifying for each the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type:** This is the protocol you want to allow in or out of your instance. For example, some common protocols to choose are HTTP/HTTPS for web traffic, SSH for secure communication, or TCP. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Protocol:** This will be greyed out and filled in for you, unless you select *Custom Protocol* in the Type dropdown list, in which case you can manually type the protocol yourself\n",
    "- **Port range:** A specific port number or range of port numbers traffic is allowed to access. Again this might be auto-populated depending on what protocol type you chose. \n",
    "- **Source/Destination:** For inbound rules, the source of the traffic. For outbound rules, the destination where you want the traffic to go. This can be either your own IP address, any IP address, or a custom IP address which you then enter in the next box.\n",
    "- **Description:** An optional description of what the rule is and why it is there\n",
    "- **Rule Number (for NACLs only):** The order of precedence for which rules to evaluate first. AWS recommends you number rules using increments of 100, so that you can add more in between if necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "The image below is an example of adding outbound rules to a Security Group. In this particular case the rule is set to allow HTTP traffic out to any IPv4 address. HTTP automatically uses a TCP connection and comes from port 80 of the instance."

    "In this Hands-On we are going to set up the security so that two EC2 instances in separate subnets can communicate with eachother. This will involve creating both instances, then creating and configuring Security Group and NACL inbound and outbound rules for each. We will be using only free tier resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create and Configure The EC2 instances\n",
    "- Log in to your AWS management console and navigate to EC2 using the search bar. Make sure the region is set to Ireland.\n",

    "- In *Network settings* select a VPC and public subnet (you can use one from a previous Hands-on)\n",
    "- Select *Enable* for *Auto-assign public IP*. In order to connect to our EC2s from the AWS console they need to have public IP addresses assigned to them.\n",
    "- Make sure that *Create security group* is selected, but *Allow SSH traffic from* is deselected (we are going to manually configure this in a later step)\n",
    "- Leave everything else the same then press *Launch instance*\n",
    "- Complete this whole step once more to create another EC2 instance, making sure to call it something different and placing it in a separate subnet\n",

    "It is made up of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rule Group:** A reusable collection of criteria which decide whether packets in a traffic flow are allowed to pass or drop. For example, if the traffic came from a particular range of IP addresses. Rule groups are either stateless or stateful: stateless rule groups evaluate packets in isolation, while stateful rule groups evaluate them in the context of their traffic flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Firewall Policy:** A reusable collection of Rule Groups, along with some policy-level behaviour such as what happens if traffic breaks midstream, and default actions for both stateless and stateful traffic.\n",
    "- **Firewall:** Connects the Firewall Policy to the VPC. Each Firewall requires at least one Firewall Policy. The Firewall additionally defines settings like how to monitor and log network traffic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)\n",
    ">*AWS WAF* is a network protection and monitoring service specifically designed for HTTP/HTTPS traffic to and from web application resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "It works by defining traffic rules and then associating them with web application resources. A rule describes traffic patterns to look for in requests and to specify the actions to take on matching requests. These actions can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow the requests to go to the protected resource for processing and response\n",
    "- Block the requests\n",
    "- Count the requests\n",
    "- Run CAPTCHA or challenge checks against requests to verify human users and standard browser use\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS WAF is made up of the following components:\n",

    "- **Rules:** Rules contain statements that define the traffic inspection criteria, then the action to take if a request meets the criteria. For example:\n",
    "    - Defining IP addresses or ranges which requests come from\n",
    "    - The country or location which requests originate from\n",
    "    - You can check for specific known malicious request attributes such as the query string, the request header value or body values\n",

    "## VPC Monitoring\n",
    ">At a high level, *network monitoring* or *logging* is the process of documenting every event that takes place on a device. From a networking perspective, this allows you to ensure security by observing the flow of traffic in and out of your network at a fine granularity, in addition to optimising your resources. It is a crucial part of developing a robust network infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "When discussing network monitoring or logging it is common to use some of the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Throughput:** The rate of traffic, in bytes per second, passing through a device during a specific time period\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uptime**: Also known as *availability*, this is the amount of time that a network device successfully sends and receives data\n",
    "- **Bandwidth:** The amount of data, in bytes, that is currently being sent or received by a device. Engineers track both the volume of traffic being sent, and the percentage of total bandwidth that is being utilised.\n",
    "- **CPU utilisation:** Also sometimes called *compute*. This metric is how much a device has used its computational capacity to process input, store data, and create output.\n",
    "- **Interface errors/discards:** These are errors on the receiving device that cause a network interface to drop a data packet. Interface errors and discards can stem from configuration errors or bandwidth issues, for example.\n",
    "- **IP metrics:** IP metrics such as *latency* can measure the speed and efficiency of connections between devices.\n",

    ">*AWS CloudWatch* is a service which monitors any of your AWS resources or applications hosted on AWS resources, in real time. It is a metrics repository which you can use to collect, organise and visualise metrics in graph and dashboard form. You can also create alarms to watch metrics and send automatic notifications or automatically change resources when a threshold is breached. For example, you could monitor CPU usage of an EC2 instance then use that data to decide whether to launch a new instance to handle increased load.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the core concepts fundamental to understanding AWS CloudWatch:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Namespaces:** A namespace is a container for metrics. There is a different, isolated namespace for each AWS service that produces CloudWatch-supported metrics, refer to [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html) documentation for the full list. Namespaces are denoted as \"AWS/<service>\", so metrics for an EC2 instance would be from the AWS/EC2 namespace\n",
    "- **Metrics:** The most fundamental concept of CloudWatch, a metric is a stream of data points produced by a single variable over time. The SSD storage being used for an RDS instance usage, for example.\n",
    "- **Dimensions**: Key/value pairs that help to categorise metrics. You can assign multiple dimensions to each metric, which then allows you to split the same metric into subcategories, which is useful for aggregating statistics with them later. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example, you have a prod and a dev EC2 instance in two different regions, but you want to calculate their CPU usage separately. To achieve this you would assign them each a dimension for their server type, and for their region, which would ultimately look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Dimensions: Server=Prod, Region=eu-west-1, Unit: CPU Usage, Timestamp: 2016-10-31T12:30:00Z, Value: 10%\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resolution:** The frequency at which the metric data points are gathered. This is either *Standard* or *High* resolution. Standard resolution is data gathered at a one minute time interval, high resolution is at one second.\n",
    "- **Statistics:** Aggregations of metrics over specific periods of time\n",
