    "# Connecting Amazon VPCs\n",
    "An Amazon VPC is by default a range of private IP addresses, and it requires an array of components to be able to communicate with the public internet. There are various other methods of connecting Amazon VPCs to external networks and services, each providing different features and benefits. It's important to know about these alternative connectivity options so that you can make the most informed decisions when building and maintaining VPCs and their surrounding infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will explore the most commonly used methods for connecting a VPC to another VPC, different AWS services, or an on-premises network. These are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *VPC Peering* is for connecting together two VPCs\n",
    "\n",
    "- *VPC Endpoints* are for connecting your VPC to other public AWS services such as S3 or DynamoDB\n",
    "- A *Site-to-Site VPN* connection is a simple way to connect an on-premises network to a VPC over the public internet\n",
    "- *AWS Direct Connect* allows you to connect an on-premises network to a VPC using a private, dedicated connection\n",
    "- *AWS Transit Gateway* enables multiple VPCs to connect to each other, and use a Site-to-Site VPN connection or Direct Connect to link an on-premises network"

    "Some key features and benefits of VPC peering\n",
    "- Instances in each VPC can communicate with each other as if they are in the same VPC\n",
    "\n",
    "- The connection uses existing AWS infrastructure which means it does not rely on a separate piece of physical hardware or require a separate AWS service. This also means there is no single point of failure or a bandwidth bottleneck.\n",
    "- You can peer accross AWS accounts, as well as different AWS regions\n",
    "- You can reference Security Groups in a peered VPC as if they are in your own VPC\n",

    "- VPCs must not have any overlapping CIDR blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "- VPC peering is not *transitive*, which means that each connection links two single VPCs only. For example, if there is a peering connection between VPCs A and B, and also a peering connection between VPCs B and C, then VPCs A and C are not then automatically peered. You need to set up a separate peering connection between VPCs A and C.\n",
    "- In order for instances in each VPC to communicate with each other, you need to configure the route tables in the relevant subnets of each VPC to contain the correct routes"

    "- Interface Endpoints have a private IP address provisioned to it by *AWS PrivateLink*, which is a service that uses Network Load Balancers to connect to external AWS services using a high-speed connection. (A *Network Load Balancer* is a service that distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, to ensure high availability and reliability.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are made up of one or more *Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)*, which are standalone networking components that allow you to control networking to a compute instance, but keep it separate from the instance\n",
