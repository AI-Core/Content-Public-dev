    "# Communication Protocols\n",
    ">Sending data between computers over the internet is a complex process, particularly because of the huge diversity of different computer operating systems and hardware. To ensure reliable data exchange there are established rules known as protocols that govern how computers communicate with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protocols can be defined in one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stateful** protocols track and retain information about the state of a connection. They are a bit like a telephone call: a constant connection between the two parties must be established before communication can occur. In stateful protocols it is the server's job to retain the session information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stateless** protocols conversely do not retain information about the state of a connection. Consider an SMS text message: the receiver's availability is not confirmed before the message is sent. There is no confirmation from the receiving device to the sending device that the message has been received.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protocols standardise the steps of the packet transfer process to ensure that they are disassembled and reassembled properly at either end of the transfer. These are the main protocols you need to know about: HTTP, TCP and UDP."

    "## HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)\n",
    ">HTTP is the foundation of the World Wide Web, governing how information is transmitted and displayed across the internet. It establishes a standardised set of rules for communication between web browsers (clients) and web servers. The basis of HTTP lies in its request-response model, where a client sends a *request* to a server, and the server responds with a *response*. HTTP is located at layer 7 (the application layer) of the OSI model. Revisit [this](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AI-Core/Content-Public-dev/blob/main/Content/units/Cloud-and-DevOps/16.%20Networking/2.%20Communication%20Protocols/Notebook.ipynb) notebook to remind yourself about the OSI model. The 'S' in HTTPS stands for secure, meaning a layer of encryption has been added to the transferred data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP is a **stateless** protocol because both the request and response contain all of the information they need to fulfill their purpose; there is no need for the server to retain any state information about the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Request\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The method:** HTTP operates through a set of methods that dictates the action to be performed on a given resource. Commonly used methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `GET`: The `GET` method requests data to be sent from the server to the client. When you enter a URL into your web browser you are making a `GET` request for the website information.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `POST`: This method allows data to be sent from a client to the server. For example, filling out a form with personal details. When you press 'Submit', a `POST` request is being made.\n",
    "    - `PUT`: Similar to `POST`, a `PUT` request also sends data from a client to a server. The main difference is that `PUT` is idempotent, which means multiple occurences of the same `PUT` request have the same effect as only one `PUT` request. Whereas multiple occurences of the same `POST` requests mean the same data is being sent and received multiple times.\n",
    "    - `DELETE`: This method deletes the specified resource\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **The version:** HTTP/3 is the most recent version\n",
    "- **A request header:** Metadata of the request in key-value pairs which can be used to facilitate authentication, manage session state, and more efficiently decide what data is to be transferred. \n",
    "- **A request body:** The information that has to be transferred\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Response\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A status code:** This tells us if the data transfer is successful or not\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A response header:** Core information about the response such as the language and format of the data being sent\n",
    "- **A response body:** The actual requested information. In most web requests, this is HTML data that a web browser will translate into a webpage."
