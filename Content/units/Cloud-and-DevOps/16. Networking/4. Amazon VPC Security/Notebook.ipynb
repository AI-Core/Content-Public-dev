    "## Security Groups\n",
    ">*Security Groups* are collections of rules which control the network traffic in and out of the **instances** they are associated with, such as EC2 or RDS instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the important characteristics of Security Groups you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you create a VPC, a Security Group is created by default, which is set to allow all traffic in and out of the instances it is associated with\n",
    "\n",
    "- They can only be made to allow traffic, not deny\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are *stateful*, which means if a connection is allowed, it will continue to exist bidirectionally until it is closed. In other words, security groups retain the state of a connection throughout the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Group Rules\n",
    "Security Group rules are created as either inbound or outbound rules, where inbound traffic comes from an external source to the instance, and outbound traffic comes from the instance to an external destination. Each rule specifies the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type:** This is the protocol you want to allow in or out of your instance. For example, some common protocols to choose are HTTP/HTTPS for web traffic, SSH for secure communication, or TCP. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Protocol:** This will be greyed out and filled in for you, unless you select *Custom Protocol* in the Type dropdown list, in which case you can manually type the protocol yourself\n",
    "- **Port range:** A specific port number or range of port numbers traffic is allowed to access. Again this might be auto-populated depending on what protocol type you chose. \n",
    "- **Source/Destination:** For inbound rules, the source of the traffic. For outbound rules, the destination where you want the traffic to go. This can be either your own IP address, any IP address, or a custom IP address which you then enter in the next box.\n",
    "- **Description:** An optional description of what the rule is and why it is there"

    "\n",
    "#### NACLs and Ephemeral Ports\n",
    "For an instance and a target to establish a connection they must use ports: the instance connects to a *defined port* on the target, and expects a response on an *ephemeral port*. This is important to remember when creating NACL rules, since NACLs are stateless. \n",
    "\n",
    "When creating rules for inbound traffic we need to open the required ephemeral port range so that a response can be received by the instance. The port range varies depending on the instance's operating system: Linux machines use 32768-61000, most recent Windows versions use 49152-65535, for example."

For example, if the traffic came from a particular range of IP addresses. Rule groups are either stateless or stateful: stateless rule groups evaluate packets in isolation, while stateful rule groups evaluate them in the context of their traffic flow. \n",
