    "## Security Groups\n",
    ">*Security Groups* are collections of rules which control the network traffic in and out of the **instances** they are associated with, such as EC2 or RDS instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the important characteristics of Security Groups you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you create a VPC, a Security Group is created by default, which is set to allow all traffic in and out of the instances it is associated with\n",
    "\n",
    "- They can only be made to allow traffic, not deny\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are *stateful*, which means if a connection is allowed, it will continue to exist bidirectionally until it is closed. In other words, security groups retain the state of a connection throughout the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Group Rules\n",
    "Security Group rules are created as either inbound or outbound rules, where inbound traffic comes from an external source to the instance, and outbound traffic comes from the instance to an external destination. Each rule specifies the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type:** This is the protocol you want to allow in or out of your instance. For example, some common protocols to choose are HTTP/HTTPS for web traffic, SSH for secure communication, or TCP. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Protocol:** This will be greyed out and filled in for you, unless you select *Custom Protocol* in the Type dropdown list, in which case you can manually type the protocol yourself\n",
    "- **Port range:** A specific port number or range of port numbers traffic is allowed to access. Again this might be auto-populated depending on what protocol type you chose. \n",
    "- **Source/Destination:** For inbound rules, the source of the traffic. For outbound rules, the destination where you want the traffic to go. This can be either your own IP address, any IP address, or a custom IP address which you then enter in the next box.\n",
    "- **Description:** An optional description of what the rule is and why it is there"

    "### Hands-On: Configuring Security Groups for a Web Server and Database\n",
    "In the following common scenario, a website is being hosted on a web server, which communicates with a database server to store data such as customer, product, or sales information. We need to set up the security groups for both web server and database server so that they can communicate with each other securely. A typical architecture for this set up would be for the web server to be hosted in a public subnet and the database in a private subnet."

    "\n",
    "These are the important characteristics of NACLs you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each subnet must be associated with one NACL. New subnets get a default NACL, which accepts all inbound and outbound traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- NACLs can be customised to allow or deny traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "- NACL rules are numbered. Rules are evaluated in order of their rule number, so lower numbers get a higher precedence. The first matching rule decides whether to allow or deny the traffic.\n",
    "For example, traffic will be allowed in to an instance if there is a rule of number 100 which allows it, even if there is another rule of number 200 which denies it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- They are *stateless*, which means that every request and response in and out of a subnet is checked against the rules exclusively\n",

    "NACL rules contain all of the same rules as Security Group rules, with the addition of two extra fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rule Number:** The order of precedence for which rules to evaluate first. AWS recommends you number rules using increments of 100, so that you can add more in between if necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Allow/Deny:** Whether the rule is to allow or deny traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for NACLs the **Source** field is not a drop down list, you must enter the CIDR block manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NACLs and Ephemeral Ports\n",
    "For an instance and a target to establish a connection they must use ports: the instance connects to a *defined port* on the target, and expects a response on an *ephemeral port*. This is important to remember when creating NACL rules, since NACLs are stateless. \n",
    "\n",
    "When creating rules for inbound traffic we need to open the required ephemeral port range so that a response can be received by the instance. The port range varies depending on the instance's operating system: Linux machines use 32768-61000, most recent Windows versions use 49152-65535, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below is an example of adding outbound rules to a Security Group. In this particular case the rule is set to allow HTTP traffic out to any IPv4 address. HTTP automatically uses a TCP connection and comes from port 80 of the instance."

    "- **Rule Group:** A reusable collection of criteria which decide whether packets in a traffic flow are allowed to pass or drop. For example, if the traffic came from a particular range of IP addresses. Rule groups are either stateless or stateful: stateless rule groups evaluate packets in isolation, while stateful rule groups evaluate them in the context of their traffic flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Firewall Policy:** A reusable collection of Rule Groups, along with some policy-level behaviour such as what happens if traffic breaks midstream, and default actions for both stateless and stateful traffic.\n",

    "- Allow the requests to go to the protected resource for processing and response\n",

    "    - Defining IP addresses or ranges which requests come from\n",
    "    - The country or location which requests originate from\n",
    "    - You can check for specific known malicious request attributes such as the query string, the request header value or body values\n",
