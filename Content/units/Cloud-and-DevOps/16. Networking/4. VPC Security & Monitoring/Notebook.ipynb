    "## What is Network Monitoring?\n",
    "--Network monitoring or logging is the process of documenting every event that takes place on a device. \n",
    "\n",
    "Network engineers and administrators typically use network monitoring tools to collect the following types of metrics from network devices:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uptime\n",
    "The amount of time that a network device successfully sends and receives data.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU utilization/also called 'compute'?\n",
    "The extent to which a network device has used its computational capacity to process input, store data, and create output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bandwidth usage\n",
    "The amount of data, in bytes, that is currently being sent or received by a specific network interface. Engineers track both the volume of traffic being sent, and the percentage of total bandwidth that is being utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughput\n",
    "The rate of traffic, in bytes per second, passing through an interface on a device during a specific time period. Engineers typically track throughput of a single interface, and the sum of the throughput of all interfaces on a single device.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interface errors/discards\n",
    "These are errors on the receiving device that cause a network interface to drop a data packet. Interface errors and discards can stem from configuration errors, bandwidth issues, or other reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "IP metrics\n",
    "IP metrics, such as time delay and hop count, can measure the speed and efficiency of connections between devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in cloud environments, companies purchase compute and network resources from cloud vendors who maintain the physical infrastructure that will run their services or applications. Cloud hosting therefore shifts the responsibility of managing the physical hardware onto the cloud vendor.\n",
