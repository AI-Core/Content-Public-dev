It involves a three-step process to establish a connection between the client and server before data is transferred, followed by a four-step connection termination process. Each of these processes can sometimes be referred to as a *handshake*.\n",

It uses a relatively simpler request-response process, and is sometimes referred to as being *connectionless*, which means that no formal connection is established before data is transferred. The result of this is that data can be transferred very quickly, but comes at the cost of reliability, as data is more likely to be lost in the transmission. \n",
