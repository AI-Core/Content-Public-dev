## EC2 (30 mins)
- explain what EC2 is
- show the different EC2 instance types available by spec, especially those with GPU
- compare an instance to your device by RAM and #CPUs
- show the pricing of these instance types
- walk through setting up an EC2 instance
    - explain what a machine Image is
        - show the Deep Learning image which comes with preinstalled PyTorch etc
        [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/tutorial-pytorch.html)

- now that it's set up, we need to log in
- First we need to create a key pair, so we can establish an SSH connection
- explain what SSH is and show an example of sshing into the newly created instance
- show how to ssh into the instance using the AWS console

- The rest of the lesson is a walkthough to see how to get everything sorted out. 
- The challenge is simply running the cat scraper from the previous notebook in a terminal inside the EC2
- Just check on the students regularly (They should be fine, since everything is well detailed)
