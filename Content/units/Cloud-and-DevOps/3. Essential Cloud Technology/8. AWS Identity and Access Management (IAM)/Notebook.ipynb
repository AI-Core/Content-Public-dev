    "## Key Concepts of IAM\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will introduce you to key concepts in IAM. At the end of this notebook you will also get hands-on practice with all the concepts introduced here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IAM Users\n",
    "\n",
    "> **IAM users** are entities within AWS that represent individual users, applications, or services that interact with AWS resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each IAM user has a unique identity with associated credentials (username and password or *access keys* (we will talk more about access keys later on) and permissions. IAM users are associated with specific roles and are granted permissions to perform actions on AWS resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating and Managing IAM Users\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an IAM user, you can use the AWS Management Console, *AWS CLI*, or *AWS SDKs*. **The AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)** is a tool that allows you to interact with AWS services using commands from your local computer's command line. We will learn more about the AWS CLI and how to provision it in the next lesson. **AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits)** are libraries and APIs provided by AWS to help developers integrate AWS services into their applications, making it easier to programmatically interact with services like IAM. We will also learn how to use the AWS Python SDK later in this pathway.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the creation process, you specify the user's name, assign a password or *access keys*, and configure their permissions by attaching appropriate IAM policies. Once created, IAM users can be managed by modifying their permissions, enabling *multi-factor authentication (MFA)*, and updating other user details as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IAM Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "> **IAM groups** are collections of IAM users with similar roles or responsibilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grouping users simplifies permission management, as permissions can be assigned at the group level instead of individually. IAM groups streamline access control by facilitating assignment and revocation of permissions for multiple users simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating and Managing IAM Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an IAM group, you can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. You define the group's name, attach IAM policies to specify permissions, and then add IAM users to the group. IAM groups can be modified by adding or removing users, updating group policies, or deleting the group when no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IAM Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "> **IAM roles** serve as a means to define a set of permissions and access policies that can be assumed by trusted entities, such as AWS services or external identities. These roles allow temporary and restricted access to AWS resources without the need for permanent credentials or sharing of long-term access keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating and Managing IAM Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "IAM roles can be created using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. During creation, you define the *trusted entities* (e.g., AWS services or federated identities), configure the role's permissions with IAM policies, and assign the role to the appropriate entities. IAM roles are adjustable by modifying associated policies, updating trusted entities, or adjusting role details as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trusted Entities\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **trusted entity** refers to an entity or entity type that is considered reliable and authorized to assume an IAM role. In the context of IAM, trusted entities can include AWS services, federated identities, or other AWS accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AWS Services**: Certain AWS services are configured to trust IAM roles. These services can assume the specified roles to perform actions on behalf of the roles' permissions. For example, AWS Lambda functions can be configured to assume an IAM role to access other AWS resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Federated Identities**: Federated identities are external identities that are authenticated by an external identity provider (IdP) and then trusted by AWS. Examples of federated identities include users authenticated through SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) or OpenID Connect (OIDC) providers. IAM roles can be assumed by these federated identities to access AWS resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **AWS Accounts**: IAM roles can also be used for cross-account access, allowing one AWS account to grant permissions to entities in another AWS account. This is particularly useful when organizations need to provide controlled access to resources across multiple AWS accounts without sharing long-term credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IAM Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "> **IAM policies** are `JSON` documents that define permissions, specifying allowed or denied actions on AWS resources. Policies consist of statements that include the effect (*allow* or *deny*), the actions permitted or denied, the affected resources, and optional conditions for access granting or restriction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating and Managing IAM Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "IAM policies can be created and managed using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Custom policies or predefined AWS managed policies can be used. Policies are attached to IAM users, groups, or roles to define their permissions. They can be updated, modified, and attached or detached as needed to control resource access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access and Secret Access Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access** keys are long-term credentials used to authenticate programmatic access to AWS services via API calls, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Each access key consists of an *access key ID* and a *secret access key*. These keys are used to securely sign requests sent to AWS services, allowing users to interact programmatically with AWS resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Managing Access and Secret Access Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access and secret access keys** can be generated for IAM users to provide programmatic access. The keys should be securely managed and stored. IAM users can create and manage their own access keys, or administrators can generate them on behalf of users. It's important to regularly rotate access keys to maintain security best practices and minimize the potential impact of compromised credentials."

    "## Understanding IAM Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle of Least Privilege\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a company with multiple employees, each responsible for different tasks within your AWS environment. Some employees need access to your **Amazon S3 buckets** to upload and download files, while others need to manage your **EC2 instances** or configure your database. Don't worry about the terminology of different services here, as we will cover them in detail in later lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, without IAM, granting access to these resources would be challenging. You would have to share the same credentials, such as the AWS account username and password, with all employees. This approach poses significant security risks because it means giving everyone full access to all your resources, including the ability to modify or delete critical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with IAM, you can enforce the *principle of least privilege*. Let's say you have an employee named Sarah who works as a developer and needs access to your EC2 instances. Instead of giving her full administrative rights, you can create an IAM user account specifically for her and assign her only the necessary permissions to manage EC2 instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for another employee named John, who is responsible for managing your database, you can create a separate IAM user account and assign him permissions to interact with your database service, such as creating and deleting database instances, but without providing access to other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "By granting these granular permissions, you ensure that each employee has access only to the resources required for their respective tasks. This practice significantly reduces the risk of accidental or intentional misuse of your resources. If, in the future, Sarah no longer needs access to EC2 instances, you can simply revoke her permissions within IAM without affecting any other aspect of your AWS environment."

    "### Granting and Revoking IAM Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "IAM provides a flexible framework for granting and revoking permissions to users, groups, and roles. You can assign permissions by attaching IAM policies directly to IAM entities, such as users or groups, or by using *resource-based policies *for certain AWS services. Permissions can be granted at various levels, including the account level, service level, or resource level, allowing for precise control over access to specific actions and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have an IAM user named `Alice` who is responsible for managing EC2 instances within your AWS environment. To grant Alice the necessary permissions, you can create an IAM policy that allows her to start, stop, and terminate EC2 instances. The `JSON` policy might look like this:"

    "\n",
    "- `\"Action\": [...]`: This line specifies the action(s) that are allowed or denied. Here, the actions `\"ec2:StartInstances\"`, `\"ec2:StopInstances\"`, and `\"ec2:TerminateInstances\"` are allowed. These actions relate to starting, stopping, and terminating EC2 instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"Resource\": \"*\"`: This line specifies the resource to which the actions apply. In this case, the wildcard character (`*`) is used to indicate that the actions can be performed on any resource. We will see in later lessons how we can specify only certain resources in IAM policies.\n",

Resource-based policies provide a more centralized and flexible approach to access control, enabling you to grant or deny access to resources based on specific conditions or identities."

    "## IAM Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Strong and Secure Passwords\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating IAM users, it is essential to encourage the use of strong and unique passwords. Strong passwords should be long, contain a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information, such as names or birthdays. Regularly remind users to update their passwords and avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Factor Authentication** adds an extra layer of security to IAM user accounts. By requiring an additional authentication factor, such as a one-time password generated by a virtual MFA device, MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if the user's password is compromised. Encourage the use of MFA for all IAM users, especially for accounts with elevated privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularly Reviewing and Auditing IAM Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Periodically reviewing and auditing IAM permissions is crucial to maintain the principle of least privilege and ensure that users have only the necessary access. Regularly review IAM policies, user permissions, and group memberships to identify any excessive or outdated permissions. Remove or modify permissions as needed to align with user roles and responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing IAM Password Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "IAM password policies allow you to enforce specific password requirements across your AWS account. Consider implementing policies that enforce password complexity rules, require password rotation at regular intervals, and prevent password reuse. By implementing strong password policies, you enhance the overall security of IAM user accounts."

Each service page has an **Actions table** that will give a comprehensive overview of each action you can specify for this service and what it does.\n",

    "\n",
    "- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a crucial service for managing user access and permissions within AWS environments\n",
    "- IAM allows you to enforce the principle of least privilege by granting and revoking granular permissions to users and entities, ensuring they have only the necessary access required for their specific tasks\n",
    "- Creating IAM users enables individual users, applications, or services to interact with AWS resources, and IAM groups provide a convenient way to manage permissions for users with similar roles or responsibilities\n",
    "- IAM roles are used to delegate permissions to entities such as AWS services or external identities without the need for long-term access keys associated with IAM users\n",
    "- IAM policies, defined in `JSON `format, specify the permissions granted or denied for IAM users, groups, or roles. They determine what actions are allowed or denied on AWS resources.\n",
    "- Best practices for IAM include creating strong and secure passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), regularly reviewing and auditing permissions, implementing IAM password policies, and considering federating AWS access with external identity providers"
