# Data lakes vs Data Warehouses
- the databases we have looked at so far are examples of what we call a data warehouse
    - data warehouses are databases which store data with columns that represent meaningful concepts like name, age id
    - advantages
        - we can easily use SQL to run queries on a data to get insights
    - disadvantages
        - we need to know what columns (features) we need in advance, as the fastest databases have fixed schemas
            - we may have to throw away part of our data if it doesnt fit into our existing schema, even though it might turn out to be useful later
        - not suitable for storing complex/"unstructured" data like images, videos or text, where each feature of the data does not have an obvious or consistent column name
            - it doesnt make sense to store an image in a database with each pixel in a separate column
- an alternative way to store data is in file format in a filesystem what we call a data lake
    - data lakes are storage services into which we can dump data in its raw format
    - advantages
        - we don't need to do any preprocessing of our data before storing it, and can save that for a later stage in the pipeline
        - we don't need to know what parts of the data will be useful in advance - we can just store all of it
        - it makes sense to store complex data like images, text, video and audio in a data lake
        - the cheapest way to store data when using the cloud
    - disadvantages
        - we can't run analytics queries on the data directly like we can with data in an SQL database
    - AWS S3 is the world's most widely used data lake
# S3
- S3 is a service for file storage in the cloud
    - S3 stands for Simple Storage Service
- open the S3 console and manually upload a file, then download it
- terminology
    - objects = files
    - keys = filenames
- folders dont exist except in part of filenames
    - we can create them in the console, but they dont represent actual objects

## Installing the AWS CLI
- we dont have to use AWS through the graphical console
- we can also interact with it programatically
- you can do everything you can do in the console from the terminal, in code
    - [ASK] any idea why we would do this?
        - repeatability
        - reduce human error
        - increase speed and frequency
- one way we can do this is through using it's CLI (Command Line Interface)
    - search "download AWS CLI" and follow the instructions for your OS
    - or run `pip install awscli` in your terminal
- once you've done that, your terminal should recognise `aws` as a command
- run `aws configure`
- the square brackets
- here you need to provide your credentials
- so we need to use another AWS service called IAM (Identity and Access Managament)
    - this is basically where you can create roles with different permissions
    - on the left we can see 
        - user groups, users, policies and roles
        - for now, click into users and we will see how the other things are used
    - create a new user with your name
        - give programmatic access
        - leave the tags blank
    - copy the public and private keys
- test that your installation is working by using `aws s3 ls`

- region name codes are shown in the drop down
    - pick one and stick with it

# Using the CLI
- run `aws s3 ls` to list your s3 buckets
- show the aws cli docs
    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/index.html
- [CHALLENGES] (15 mins)
    - from the terminal...
    - create an s3 bucket
    - delete it
    - create another
    - upload a file to it
    - delete it and upload it again
    - rename the file
    - move the file into a folder
- now let's check our S3 bucket exists in the console and contains the bucked
- obviously, it's the same process for all the other AWS services

# Boto3
- as well as using the command line interface, we can also use an SDK
- boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python
- `pip install boto3`
- under the hood, boto3 is using the AWS CLI
    - that means that you dont need to configure boto3 if you've configured the AWS CLI.
- do the same challenges as above in python using boto3
