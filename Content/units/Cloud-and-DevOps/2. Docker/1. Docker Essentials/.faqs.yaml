  question: Docker can't find "google-chrome-stable" when building the image
- answer: You can check what is taking up the space on the drive by install a small
    package ncdu. One installed run ncdu from the root directory to see the file sizes
    of all files. Then using rm -rf <name of the folder> to remove the corresponding
    folder to free up space on the drive.

  question: My EC2 instance is too full to run my Docker image
- answer: 'This can be due to a mismatch between the chromedriver version and the
    version of chrome. Change the Dockerfile line where you specifiy the chromedriver
    version to a version compatible with your version of chrome. '

  question: 'My Scraper Docker container returns the error "Time out receiving message
    from the renderer" when trying to run the container in headless on EC2. '
- answer: 'There might be multiple reasons, but two of the most commons are:


    1. You are not in the right directory. When you create the Docker image, the Dockerfile
    has to be in the directory you specify in the docker build command


    2. The other reason is because the Dockerfile hasn''t been named properly. The
    extension of a Dockerfile has to be Dockerfile (capitalized). If you have only
    a single dockerfile in your project, you can just named it Dockerfile, with no
    extension at all. However, if you want to add more dockerfiles to your project,
    you need to specify the dockerfile you are going to use to build the image by
    adding the -f flag to the docker build command'

  question: I am trying to create the Docker image, but whenever I run the docker
    build command, it just throws an error. What am I doing wrong?
- answer: "Docker images or EC2 instances don't support any sort of GUI applications,\
    \ so you need to set headless mode. However, that might not be enough, you have\
    \ to allow your browser use your mouse, so you need to use the no-sandox option\n\
    The last issue you might find, is that, when you use Chrome in selenium, it tries\
    \ to store all the information in a directory called dev/shm, but if that's not\
    \ enough, Chrome will crash. To avoid it, you can use a workaround that will store\
    \ the info in a temporary file. \n\nSo, the code you should add when creating\
    \ the webdriver should look like this:\n\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom\
    \ selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options\n\nchrome_options = Options()\n\
    chrome_options.add_argument('--headless')\nchrome_options.add_argument('--no-sandbox')\n\
    chrome_options.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')\n\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome('/path/to/your_chrome_driver_dir/chromedriver',\
    \ chrome_options=chrome_options)"

  question: 'When I run my scraper locally, it works fine. Even when I run a container
    using selenium, it works without any issue. However, when I run it on an EC2 instance,
    I receive the following error: "devToolsActivePort file doesn''t exist" '
- answer: 'Yes! You just need a bit of experience with the command line interface,
    but we are sure that at this point this will be easy!


    First, your container should be running, otherwise, there won''t be anything to
    access to. Run the command "docker ps" to see all the containers that are currently
    running


    Find the container that you want to get access to, you can either use the name
    or the id. Then run "docker exec -it <name or id of the container> /bin/bash"


    And it would be like you were inside another computer! From there, simply navigate
    to the file you want to change, and change it using nano or vim (You might need
    to install one of those editors inside the container)'

  question: I want to change a file that is stored in a Docker container, is there
