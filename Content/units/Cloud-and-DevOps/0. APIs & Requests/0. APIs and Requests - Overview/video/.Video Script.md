# APIs and Requests

## Setup

- Create a GitHub repo and make it public. YOu are going to GET information about this repository through the github API.
  - In my case I am using AiCore-Test2, so when requesting the info about that repo, I will write https://api.github.com/repos/IvanYingX/AiCore-Test2 (You can actually click here to check the expected response)
  - In your case, change it to the name you use in your repo

### What do I need open?

- Terminal
  - You are going to use the `curl` command to make some requests
- Safari
  - Open GitHub
  - You are going to show how to create a Personal Access Token
  - You are going to create a Personal Access Token to create a repo from the API
  - YOu are going to show that the repo has been created
- VSCode
  - api_requests.ipynb
    - You are going to use the requests library to get information about a public repo
    - Before start recording, go to the notebook and replace the repos in the URL with your repos
- OBS

### What recording scenes do I need open?

- Screencapture of the mentioned disposition with your webcam capture in the corner
- Webcam capture in full screen

## Script

- picture interacting with your favourite products. they might be netflix, uber, or airbnb for example
- you tap things and interact with those systems through a graphical user interface
- of course, under the hood, all of this is just running code
- so there must of course be a programmable interface
- the button runs some code which interacts with the application through a graphical interface
- the code sends a message to ubers system and tells them to send you a ride
- the code doesn't interact with the system's database directly
- that would be a security risk, and it would make it much harder for you to use the application

- think of a TV remote, it gives you specific buttons which do specific things, and only those things

  - the remote is an interface for you to talk to the TV
  - it doesn't provide you the full functionality, but it provides you the functionality you need and makes it easy to use
  - it also prevents you from breaking anything accidentally or intentionally

- the software which defines how you can interact with an application using code is called an application programming interface, or API
- APIs are computer programs that know what to do and how to respond to requests sent to them over the internet
- You will see lots of far more complicated definitions online, but it's really as simple as that.

- to illustrate the idea, i've got a question for you
- What is a browser?
- well i would describe a browser as a tool that knows how to request information and display different formats in a way that makes sense

  - when you search for that page, your browser makes a HTTPS request to a computer at that URL
  - and that computer has some code which knows what to return you - it's basically an API
  - the contents of the webpage get returned in the format of HTML, which the browser knows how to display

- Most websites are simply a graphical display wrapped around an API. The graphical display would be known as the front-end, and the API is a gateway for users to talk to the back end
- the computer running at that URL probably isn't actually an API in most cases, but it could be as simple as that

- Most of the time, what we will be doing is making what is called an _HTTP request_ to an API

### Communication protocols

- before I get further into talking about APIs, I should talk about communication protocols
- A protocol is a predefined set of rules for communicating.
- The protocol tells computers how to format the message when sending it and how to interpret the raw data when recieving it.
- you've probably heard of some computer protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, SSH or IP

### Requests

- Another key term to know about is a request
- A **request** is a message sent from one computer to another.

  - Typically a **response** is returned in the opposite direction.
  - A request must be sent using a protocol, which tells both computers the rules for how to send and interpret messages.

- in python, it's super easy to make HTTP requests using the requests library

_Run the cell making a get request to google.com_

_Show diagram of API tree_

- this diagram shows what the structure of an API might look like for an imaginary online store
- It looks a lot like a filesystem, with a tree structure
- We call each of different part of the tree an endpoint
- Each of these endpoints has a different URL, and we can make requests to that different endpoint
- This tree is an imaginary API for an online shop

- so what does that actually look like

- many applications have an API, let's take a look at a few

  - show the Zoom API documentation
  - show the slack API
  - show

- We can do more than just get information
- There are, amongst others, four main types of requests:
  - GET: for reading information provided by the API
  - POST: to upload new information to the API
  - PUT: to update information to an existing entry in the API
  - DELETE: to delete an existing entry in the API
- not all APIs need to have these different methods for each endpoint

- Also, it is important to mention that one of the most common type of APIs are RESTful APIs
  - all that you need to know about the name RESTful API, or REST API is that they are follow a particular set of standards
- And lastly, the user who sends the requests is known as the client, whereas the computer program that sends back the information is known as the server.
  - the client could be the mobile application which you are tapping
  - or it could be your python code
  - there is not necessarily any physical difference between a server and a client, and in fact your computer could be both a client, making requests, and a server, responding to requests, at the same time

### Headers

## original Script

- **`[START SCENE] webcam in full screen`**
  - Communicating two computer programs between each other is one of the common operations that take place when you browse any website or downloading a file
  - One thing that usually happens when browsing a website is that there are many APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, running behind the scenes
  - An API is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one computer program and another.
  - You can communicate with an API through a requests, in which you ask to the API what you want to do
  - So, for example, when you browse a website that allows you to create a Google Calendar Event, the website integrates an API that makes a request to the Google server to create the event
    - Another example is a website that accepts PayPal payments. When you click the "Pay with Paypal" button, the webpage sends a request to the PayPal API to process the payment
  - So, In this video we are going to introduce the concept API, and how to make different type of requests to an API
  - Before starting we need to bear in mind a few things about APIs
  - There are, amongst others, four main types of requests:
    - GET: for reading information provided by the API
    - POST: to upload new information to the API
    - PUT: to update information to an existing entry in the API
    - DELETE: to delete an existing entry in the API
  - Also, it is important to mention that one of the most common type of APIs are RESTful APIs
    - RESTful APIs, or REST APIs, follow an architectural style, and amongst other features, they give common ways to request for resources
  - And lastly, the user who sends the requests is known as the client, whereas the computer program that sends back the information is known as the server.
  - With that in mind, let's take a look at APIs

<br>

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] Open Safari`**
  - To see an example of an API, we are going to take a look at the GitHub API
  - So we can google "Github API" **`[Search in Google GitHub API]`**
  - And look for its documentation **`[Open the Link that says GitHub REST API]`**
  - Many APIs have extensive documentation, and GitHub is no exception
  - To begin with, we can see in the Overview how to make a request to the API
    - So first, we click "Overview" **`[CLICK OVERVIEW]`**, and then "Resources in the REST API" **`[CLICK Resources in the REST API]`**
  - **`[SCROLL DOWN UNTIL YOU SEE SCHEMA LIKE IN THE PICTURE]`**

<p align=center><img src=.images/Schema.png width=400></p>

- We can see in "Schema" that the URL to make a request starts with the domain name, which is https://api.github.com, followed by the parameters we want to request.

- To read about the objects we can request, we can look at the "Reference" tab on the left hand side

<p align=center><img src=.images/git_reference.png width=400></p>

- And select the object you want to request. Let's say for example that I want to see the information about a repository in my account
- So I need to click on Repositories
- Here, we can see different requests, for example, "List Organization repositories", "Delete a repository", or other requests regarding branches or commits
- Each of these requests can be either to "GET" information or to "POST" information amongst other possibilities, and the corresponding available request is included in each section
- For example, as mentioned, if we wanted to Get a repository, we can click on "Get a Repository"

<p align=center><img src=.images/GET_Repository.png width=400></p>

- And we can read the information about this request

  - We can see that the request is a GET type **`[POINT TO THE "GET"]`**
  - And the API is asking us at least for the owner and the repo name.
  - We can tell it's asking for these because these variables are between curly bracket **`[POINTING TO THE CURLY BRACKETS]`**, which is a common practice when documenting APIs

- So, as the documentation explains, to make a request to the API, first we write the domain, https://api.github.com followed by "slash-repos-slash-my github account-slash-my github repo".

  - **`[OPEN A NEW TAB IN SAFARI]`** We can try to request that information from our browser **`[TYPE https://api.github.com/repos/life-efficient/AiCore-Test2] or change with the name you are using`**
  - Our browser is able to send requests directly to the API
  - And here is the result
    - We can see the id of the repo
    - Its owner
    - or the URL amongst many other characteristics
  - Notice that the response we obtain is a JSON object, which is a common format when you request information from an API

<br>

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] Open Terminal`**
  - We can also use our terminal to make the same request
  - The corresponding command is `curl`, which stands for client URL
  - So we can run `curl https://api.github.com/repos/life-efficient/AiCore-Test2` **`[RUN THE COMMAND ON THE TERMINAL]`**
    - And we can see the same output that our browser returned us earlier

<br>

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] Open VSCode`**
- **`[OPEN api_requests.ipynb] FIRST CELL`**
  - Python has a library that helps us making requests.
  - Very intuitively, the library is named `requests`
  - So we can import requests, and use the `get` method to make a "GET" request.
  - The argument we pass is the same URL we used previously
  - And the output is assigned to the variable `response`
  - Notice that we are printing the output of the method `.json()` bound to `response`
  - **`[RUN THE CELL]`** Once again we obtain the same response
  - One important point to make on the requests library: Why did we use the method json()?
  - By default the output of any requests is the status of the response

<br>

- **`[NEXT CELL] print(response)`**
  - If we just print response, we see that the status of the response is 200
  - This number is a code corresponding to the message from the server letting you know how things went when it received the request.
  - Responses within the two hundreds mean that the request was successful

<br>

- **`[NEXT CELL] request.get() with a shorter URL`**
  - On the other hand, if the request URL doesn't exist, the response we will get is 404
  - which translates to Not Found

<br>

- **`[SHOW THE TABLE]`**
  - This table shows the codes of each message you can receive from the server
  - **`[NAME A FEW EXAMPLES]`** For example, we just got response 200, and 404, which correspond to OK, and Not Found respectively.
  - But you can also find other messages such as 503, which means that the server is down for whatever reason.
  - So, next time you need to check the meaning of your response, you can refer to this table to know it

<br>

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] webcam in full screen`**
  - Good, so now you know how to request to read information through an API
  - But, as mentioned earlier, you can make different type of requests
    - For example, you can create a repository
    - Or you could update something about your repo through the github API
  - To make this type of requests
  - To see how it works, let's go back to the API documentation

<br>

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] Open Safari with the GitHub API docs`**
  - In the same page we visited, we can look for information about how to create a repository
  - **`[CLICK THE LINK]`**

<p align=center><img src=.images/Create_Repo.png width=250></p>

- Notice that this method requires an OAuth, or Open Authorization, to make it work
- It enables apps to obtain limited access to a user's data without giving away a user's password
- You can see create a Personal Access Token to get this type of authorization, and we will see how to create one very shortly
- Many APIs will require us to provide some type of credential, usually with a token
- For now, let's focus on what we need to create the repo through the API
- **`[POINT TO THE "POST" like in the picture]`**

<p align=center><img src=.images/POST_Repo.png width=300></p>

- As opposed to the request method we saw earlier, this is a "POST" request, because we are uploading information
- Additionally, in the parameters, there is a required parameter: The name of the repository we are going to create
- So, the same way we obtain a JSON object when making a GET request, we provide a JSON object when making a POST request
- The only thing remaining now is obtaining a Personal Access Token
- We can do so by going to our GitHub account

<br>

- **`[OPEN A NEW TAB AND GO TO "github.com"]`**
  - At the upper right of the window, we can click on our profile picture **`[CLICK ON YOUR PROFILE PICTURE]`**
  - And then on settings **`[CLICK SETTINGS]`**
  - In this new window, click on Developer Settings **`[CLICK DEVELOPER SETTINGS]`**
  - And then on Personal Access Tokens **`[CLICK ON PERSONAL ACCESS TOKENS]`**
  - Then, click on generate new token **`[CLICK ON GENERATE NEW TOKEN]`**
  - and we have to provide a note and a scope
    - Here, we are just adding a note saying that this is for a GitHub API test **`[IN THE NOTE BAR, TYPE "GitHub API test"]`**
    - And for this purpose, we need to select the "repo" scope **`[Tick the "repo" box]`**
    - But depending on the purposes of the OAuth, you might need to select a different scope
    - And finally, click on "Generate token" **`[Click on Generate token]`**
  - Copy the Personal Access Token and let's go to Python to make the POST request

<br>

- **`[OPEN VSCode]`**
- **`[NEXT CELL] The cell after the HTTP responses`**
  - In this cell we paste the token I just copied
  - and I provide my username
  - From the API, the required parameter we have to provide is the name of the repo.
    - In this case, let's call it From-API
    - And convert the dictionary into a JSON object, using the dumps method
  - And finally, we use the post method from requests
    - The first argument is the API URL
    - The second one is the authorization as a tuple, where the first item is the username and the second one is the personal access token
    - And the third one is the body of the request
  - After running this cell **`[RUN THE CELL]`**, we can see that the response has a status code of 201, which corresponds to the message "Created"
  - Let's check our GitHub account to check if it was correctly created

<br>

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] Open Safari`**
- **`[GO TO "github.com"]`** - Let's search the repo we just created **`[In the search repositories type "From-API"]`** - And yeah! It looks like we have created the repository correctly
<p align=center><img src=.images/search_repo.png width=300></p>
    - We could delete or update this repository using the API, but I will leave that task to you

<br>

- **`[SWITCH SCENE] webcam in full screen`**
  - We just saw how useful APIs can be
  - You find APIs in many websites working behind the scenes
    - So it is important to understand how they work
  - We can communicate with an API through requests
  - Requests can perform "GET", "POST", or "DELETE" operations amongst others
  - If you want to know how to communicate with an API, you can check its documentation
    - Usually, the documentation is very well reported
    - So any question you might have will very likely appear
  - Thanks to APIs, you can get a great variety of data, or you could automate many tasks
  - So make sure to make a good use of APIs!
