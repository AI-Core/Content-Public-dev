# Numpy
- numpy is Python library for efficiently performing mathematical operations

_Install in terminal_


- canonical import numpy as np
 
## Arrays
- the main data type is the ndarray
- an array is a grid of numbers

_Switch to screen capture_

- you can make an array using the `np.array` method

_Make an array using `np.array(7)`_

- we call a single number a scalar

_Make an array using `np.array([1, 2])`_

- we call a list of numbers a vector

_Make an array using `np.array([[1, 2], [4, 7]])`_

- we call a list of list of numbers a matrix

_Make an array using `np.array([[1, 2], [4, 7]])`_

- and we call anything with more than 2 dimensions a _tensor_

- it's called an nd array because it's an array which can have an arbitrary number of n dimensions
- np arrays always have rectangle-like shapes... they can't have a different number of items in each row or column
- they contain either numbers or boolean values, all of the same type

# TODO show table of numpy matrix, with columns for 

## types and shapes
- np arrays can contain different types
- np array infers the types when the array is created
- you can check the type of the items it contains using the `dtype` attribute
- if we create an array out of floats then the array elements will contain a different type
- you can cast the array to another type by using the `.astype` method
- you can get the shape of an array using the .shape attribute
- you can get the transpose an array, where the rows are swapped for columns, by using the `.T` attribute
- you can reshape numbers using the `.reshape` method to any shape with the same number of elements
- if you want to let numpy infer the size of a dimension then you can put a `-1` as an argument for the size of that axis

## Creating arrays

_Switch to webcam view_

- there are loads of ways to create numpy arrays

_Switch to screen capture_

- you can create an array of ones using `np.ones`

_Create matrix of ones_

- you can create an array of zeros using `np.zeros`

_Create matrix of zeros_

- you can create an identity matrix, where all elements are zeros except the diagonal which contains all ones, by using `np.eye`

_Create identity matrix_

_Switch to webcam view_

- another common operation is creating random numpy arrays

_Switch to screen capture_

- you can create an array of random numbers from a normal distribution using `np.random.randn()`
- of an array of random numbers with a specific shape using `np.random.rand`

## Operations

_Switch to webcam view_

- arrays are like nested lists, which represent mathematical tensors
- mathematically operations like addition make sense for tensors
- but by default in python you can't use the usual operators like the addition sign to add nested lists
- that's one of the things that numpy defines the behaviour for in the `np.array` data type

_Switch to screen capture_

- so you can do things like add, subtract, and multiply element wise

_Show addition, subtraction and multiplication_

## Broadcasting
- if you try and add a scalar to a vector in numpy, it won't throw an error
- numpy infers that you mean you want to add the same scalar to every item in the vector
- a similar thing happens when you try to multiply a matrix by a vector...
- numpy infers that you want to multiply every row by the vector
- this is called broadcasting

## Matmul
- an extremely common operation, particularly in AI, is matrix multiplication
- numpy defines the behaviour for that too
- of course the dimensions have to be correct
- but you can use the `np.matmul` method to do a matrix multiplication of two matrices

## Mathematical functions
- Many of the most common mathematical operations have efficiently implementations in numpy
- one example is trignonometric functions

_Show np.sin_

- 

- There are also other useful submodules like `np.linalg` for linear algebra operations
- `np.linalg.norm`

## Indexing and slicing arrays

_Define a matrix_

- as with normal lists, you can index and slice arrays using square brackets

_Slice out a column_

- but you can also separate the usual indices by a comma to slice across multiple dimensions at once

_Slice a particular item out_

- Numpy allows for much more elaborate forms of indexing as you can see here 

_Show diagram of fancy indexing and explain what they each do_

## Common errors
- "Cannot interpret '3' as a data type"
- this occurs because the method expects a tuple of numbers, not a number
- what you're doing is passing a number as the second positional argument, when numpy expects that argument to be a data type for the elements of the array

- "Input operand 1 has a mismatch in its core dimension 0, with gufunc signature (n?,k),(k,m?)->(n?,m?) (size 6 is different from 5)"
- this is because numpy is doing to do a matrix multiplication where the inner dimensions don't match
- in this case, matrix multiplication doesn't make sense
