# Pandas

- Pandas is a python library that `provides tools to empower you to do the same kind of data manipulation and analysis that you can use spreadsheets and SQL for

- as usual, you can install pandas using `pip install pandas` or `conda install pandas`
- to follow the convention adopted by people everywhere, you should always `import pandas as pd`

## Reading data

_Read from CSV as `df`_

- you can use pandas to read CSV data, and many other data formats directly into python

## Dataframes and series

_print(type(df))_

- when you read data in, it is in the form of a pandas dataframe


- this is the main data type used by the pandas library
- and it's why you might commonly see variables called df, which contain the data

_Switch to webcam view_

- dataframes are the pandas equivalent of a spreadsheet, or a table
- they have rows and columns

_Print df_

- you can get the values in any column of a dataframe by using indexing it with that column name

_Index out column `JobTitle`_

- each column has another datatype called a pandas series

_print(type(column))_

- it's kind of like a 1 dimensional dataframe

- a handy trick is indexing the dataframe with double square brackets to return a dataframe rather than a series

_Index with [[]]_

- when you index with double brackets, you can provide a list of columns which you want to extract from the original dataframe

## Indexing
- you will notice that the dataframe has a column heading that looks slightly different to others
- that column is called the index column

- when you first read in a dataframe, it will by default have an index column filled with integer values
- you can set the index by using a dataframe's `set_index` method

- you can select out a particular record using a dataframe's `loc` method and passing in the index
- you can also do multidimensional indexing too by separating the indices for each axis by a comma

- often you want to be able to search by numerical index, rather than by column name or row id
- to do this, you can use the `iloc` method


## Basic exploration

_Switch to webcam_

- if you want a quick summary of the data in your dataframe, you can use the `.info()` and `.describe()` methods
- `.info()` tells you the number of entries, the column names, their null value counts and data types, and the memory occupied by the dataframe

_Run `.info()` on the df_

_Switch to webcam_

- it's worth pointing out that even though we'll see that pandas has some SQL-like capabilities, it isn't a tool for big data processing
- all of this data needs to be stored on your machine to be used by Python

_Switch to screen capture_

- `.describe()` shows you summary statistics of the values in each column

_Run `.describe()` on the df_

- you can also see the top n items by using the `.head` method
- or the bottom n items by using the `tail` method

## Manipulation

_Switch to webcam_

- now let's say that we want to create a new column from one that already exists by applying a function to every item in it

- as always, I don't expect you to know any of this, or remember all of it
- So let's check out the docs

_Switch to screen capture_

_Search "pandas apply function to column"_

_Open the docs and show how to read them_

_Code a small function to take in EmployeeName and split it_

_Put this into the `.apply()` method

- you can create new columns by assigning keys to the dataframe

_Set the column "first name" to the result of the apply_

- this will also overwrite existing columns

### Dropping rows and columns
- you can pass the `drop` method a list of indexes of records to remove 
- you can also drop columns by specifying the axis=1
- many pandas methods are not inplace operations by default
- they return a new dataframe rather than overwriting the existing one
- but many have an `inplace=True` argument to make the change inplace

## Indexing by masking
- applyign a comparison operator to a series will return you a boolean series full of true and false values corresponding to each row where the condition was met
- we call this a mask
- you can then index a dataframe with this mask to select only the items where the condition was met
