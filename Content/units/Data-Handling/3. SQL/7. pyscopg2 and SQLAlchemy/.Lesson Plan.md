# SQL psycopg2 and SQLAlchemy

- We can export our data to a .csv from pgAdmin
- Exporting and then read it manually is very tedious
- We can use two libraries in python to communicate with PostgreSQL

## psycopg2

- psycopg is a python library that enables the communication between PostgreSQL and Python. 
- conda install psycopg2 (if not working: pip install psycopg2-binary)
- Steps:
    - import
    - create a context manager for the connection
        - connection should include host, user, password, port, and db name
    - another context manager for the cursor that allows us to perform operations
    - execute the query

- [DEMO] Select query
- [DEMO] Create a table
- [DEMO] Delete table

- Observe the data type in each of them (lists of tuples)
## SQLAlchemy

- psycopg2 is nice, but we need to process the data after querying it, or we need to process the data for creating tables
- SQLAlchemy is an object relational mapper that maps representations of objects to database tables.
- This enables us to connect to our database seamlessly wihout worrying about connections and cursors
- The Engine object contains information about the type of database and a connection pool:
    - Connections operate simultaneously
    - Lazy evaluation: Save memory and time
- pip install SQLAlchemy

- [DEMO] Select query
- [DEMO] Create a table
- [DEMO] Delete table

- Observe the data type of what you get when you store the output of a SELECT query (list)
- Good thing about SQLAlchemy is that we can simply transform it into a dataframe, which makes life much easier
- We can also transform a dataframe into a table

## Challenge:

- Go to the Samuel L Jackson IMDB page using requests or selenium (pick your poison)
- Download the name of the films he played a role in: title, years
- Create a table in your database with this info

- Go to the Tim Roth's IMDB page using requests or selenium (pick your poison)
- Download the name of the films he played a role in: title, years
- Create a table in your database with this info

- Using SQLAlchemy, select the films where both actors had a role
- Write it into a Pandas Dataframe
