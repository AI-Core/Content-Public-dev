## Setup

### What do i need open?

- You will need to open pgAdmin4, and if you have it, open the Pagila database. Otherwise, the file can be foung in the SQL Setup lesson
- YOU might want to create a new server with a password that you don't mind sharing
- .psycopg2.ipynb
- OBS
    
### What recording scenes do I need open?

- Screencapture of pgAdmin4 with your webcam capture in the corner
- Screencapture of VSCode with your webcam capture in the corner
- Webcam capture in full screen

## Script

- __`[START SCENE] webcam in full screen`__
    - The output we get from a SQL query is something definitely useful
    - However, if we wanted to process the data even further, or use it, for example, as the input to a machine learning model, first we would need to manually export the data to a CSV file
    - Maybe doing it once is not a big deal, but if it becomes a repeatable process, we should consider automating it
    - Luckily, we can also make queries to the database using Python
    - We can use an API called psycopg2 to connect to the database, and we can send requests such as read, post, or delete
    - We can also use SQLAlchemy to connect to the database. This module uses psycopg2 behind the scenes, but additionally, it provides a simple way to communicate the data types of the columns in the database
    - Let's start with psycopg2, which is an API that connects Python with a PostgreSQL database

<br>

- __`[CHANGE SCENE] OPEN pgAdmin4`__
    - To connect to our database, we need to pass the information of said database to psycopg2
    - I am going to check the data of my pagila database
    - You can check the data if you right click on the server, and then click on Properties
    - __`[In my case the server is called aicore, change it according to the name you have]`__
    - <p align=center><img src=.images/Pagila.png width=700></p>
    - So, in my case, I right click on `aicore` and then see the properties
    - In this window, we click on `Connection`
    - <p align=center><img src=.images/Pagila_2.png width=700></p>
    - Take a look at the following properties:
        - Host, which in this case is localhost
        - Port, which in this case is 5432
        - Username, which in this case is postgres
        - Also, you will need to use your password, which is the password you set when you created the database
        - And just in case, take a look at the name of your database, in my case, it is lowercase `pagila`
    - Ok, so we are ready to make queries to the database from Python using psycopg2

<br>

- __`[CHANGE SCENE] OPEN VSCODE, .psycopg2.ipynb`__
    - The first step to use psycopg2 is to install it
    - We can install it using `pip install psycopg2`, but my recommendation is using `pip install psycopg2-binary`, which creates fewer dependencies
    - Once we install it, we need to pass the information about the dataset
    - Ok, so we set the host, the username, the name of the database, the port, and finally the password
    - __`[ENTER YOUR PASSWORD]`__

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL]`__
    - The way psycopg works is by establishing a connection, and then pointing to the database
    - In both cases, we use context managers, one for the connection as we can see in the first context manager
    - And another one for the cursor that points to the database, as we can see in the nested context manager
    - Now, the cursor can start making queries, for example using the execute method
    - Inside this method, we can pass the query as if we were writing it in pgAdmin
    - In this case, I am retrieving the first name and last name of all the customers whose first name starts with the letter 'A'
    - __`[RUN THE CELL]`__

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL]`__
    - We can also create tables using psycopg.
    - Let's create a new table and observe if it appears in the database that we can check through pgAdmin4
    - So, we are using the same query as earlier, where we retrieved all the customers whose first name starts with 'A', but instead of storing it into a variable, we create a new table called `customers_a` out of the output
    - __`[RUN THE CELL]`__
    - If everything went well, we should be able to see a new table in the database
    - Let's go to pgAdmin and check that out

<br>

- __`[CHANGE SCENE] OPEN pgAdmin4`__
    - Let's open the pagila database
    - Then, we click on 'Schemas', and then on 'Tables'
    - Probably, we need to right-click on tables and click Refresh
    - And we can see that a new table called customers_a is there
    - While we are here, let's make a SELECT query to see the content of this table
    - So, I click on the Query Tool button __`[CLICK THE QUERY TOOL]`__
    - And let's make a simple query
    ```
    SELECT * FROM customers_a
    ```
    - Nice! It seems that it's working fine.
    - Let's go back to VSCode to see other things we can do with the database from Python

<br>

- __`[CHANGE SCENE] OPEN VSCode`__
    - __`[NEXT CELL] print(type(records))`__
    - Remember the SELECT query we made earlier? We stored the data in a variable called records
    - If we print the type of this variable __`[RUN THE CELL]`__ we can see that the variable is a list
    - While this is not a great disadvantage, there are other formats that make data processing easier
    - Additionally, take a look at how we created the table, we had to write the whole query
    - Imagine if we had to do the same to create a table from scratch, the number of INSERT INTO statements can be huge!
    - Fortunately, there is another library that can help us casting dataframes into tables, and vice-versa
    - I am talking about SQLAlchemy

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] import SQLAlchemy`__
    - First of all, make sure you have SQLAlchemy installed
    - YOu can use pip install SQLAlchemy in your terminal and that would do it
    - SQLAlchemy is a toolkit that contains an Object-Relational Mapper, or ORM for short
    - I am not going to go deep into the details of an ORM, but it's basically what allows us to cast our Python objects, for example a dataframe, into a table that can be used in a relational database management system
    - Another benefit of using SQLAlchemy is its engine, which establishes the connection to the database, but it doesn't consume resources for maintaining that connection open, since it's a lazy evaluator, meaning that it only acts if we command it to do something
    - If you have already installed SQLAlchemy, let's get to it!
    - From the sqlalchemy library we import the method to create an engine that, as mentioned earlier, creates the connection
    - And then we set the properties of this engine. 
    - These properties are the same as the ones we passed to the connection in psycopg2, but notice that additionally we set the type of API
    - The reason for this is because SQLAlchemy can work with different SQL distributions.
    - We are dealing with PostgreSQL, so we need the corresponding API, in this case psycopg2
    - __`[RUN CELL]`__

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] engine = create_engine`__
    - Let's create the engine using the create_engine function we just imported
    - If the credentials are correct, the engine will be able to connect to it, and the connect method won't return any error
    - __`[RUN CELL]`__

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] insp = inspect(engine)`__
    - SQLAlchemy makes navigating through the database quite simple
    - We can inspect the content of the database using an inspector object
    - You can initialize an inspector using the inspect function, and passing the engine we have just created
    - And then use the get_table_names() method
    - __`[RUN CELL]`__
    - And the output we get is the list of tables in the database

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] query = '''`__
    - Similar to psycopg2, we can execute queries directly if we pass the query as a string
    - But be advised, the way psycopg2 and SQLAlchemy process the string is a bit different
    - So, in this cell, we have a string that contains the same query that retrieves all the customers whose first name starts with 'A'
    - The LIKE clause in the query uses the percentage character, and if we passed the query as it is now, it would not work
    - __`[RUN CELL]`__
    - And we obtain en error, saying that dictionaries are not sequences
    - The problem is caused by the percentage sign, since Python assumes that sign is use as string formatting
    - In psycopg2 it didn't happen because the string was considered as a raw string

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] query = '''`__
    - That's why SQLAlchemy has a function called `text()` that allows us to pass the query as a string and escape special characters, something we didn't do in psycopg2
    - __`[RUN CELL]`__
    - And now the query works fine
    - Still, even if we can execute queries, that doesn't solve the problem of executing long strings of queries to, for example, create tables

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] query = import pandas as pd`__
    - As mentioned earlier, SQLAlchemy works with an ORM that we can use to cast dataframes into tables and vice-versa
    - So let's see how to use pandas to do that
    - Reading and creating tables for the database using pandas is fairly easy
    - Let's see how to read a table from the database and cast it into a dataframe
    - As with many other formats, pandas can read the data using the method `read` followed by the name of the format
    - In this case, we are reading something from sql, so the method is `read_sql`
    - There are three different methods that read sql: `read_sql`, `read_sql_table`, and `read_sql_query`
    - The generic method `read_sql` accepts a query or the name of a table
    - In this case, we are passing the query we defined earlier
    - And as a second argument, we are passing the engine
    - __`[RUN CELL]`__
    - You can see that the output is a dataframe
    - And the content of the dataframe is the same as the output we got from the query

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] customers = pd.read_sql('customer', engine)`__
    - You can also pass the name of the table to this method
    - Let's see the table customer
    - __`[RUN CELL]`__
    - The output is showing the content of the table

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] customers = pd.read_sql_table(query, engine)`__
    - Another way to read tables is using the method `read_sql_table`
    - In this case, you can't pass a query, it only accepts the name of the table
    - __`[RUN CELL]`__
    - So, if we pass the query, it will not work

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] customers = pd.read_sql_table('customer', engine)`__
    - So we need to pass the name of the table
    - __`[RUN CELL]`__
    - And, as you can see, the cell showed no error

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] customers = pd.read_sql_query(query, engine)`__
    - Finally, you can use the method `read_sql_query` to read a query
    - And as you might guess, it accepts the query as a string, but not the name of the table
    - __`[RUN CELL]`__
    - Nice, this is a much easier way to read data from the database, don't you think?
    - Let's take a look at how to write data to the database

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] cars = pd.read_csv(...)`__
    - First, I am going to load a cars dataframe from a file
    - Don't worry about the details, we are just using this dataframe for example purposes
    - __`[RUN CELL]`__

<br>

- __`[NEXT CELL] cars.to_sql`__
    - Writing data to a database using pandas follows the same pattern as writing any other data type
    - So in this case we use the method `to_sql`
    - This method accepts the name of the table, the engine, and the if the table already exists, we can overwrite it
    - __`[RUN CELL]`__
    - Alright, if everything went well, we should see a new table in the database
    - Let's go to pgAdmin and check the list of tables

<br>

- __`[CHANGE SCENE] OPEN pgAdmin4`__
    - Once again, let's open the pagila database
    - And refresh the list of tables __`[RIGHT CLICK ON THE TABLES AND CLICK REFRESH]`__
    - Yes! The table we created is there, let's make a query to show all its content
    - __`[OPEN THE QUERY TOOL AND RUN THE FOLLOWING QUERY]`__
    ```
    SELECT * FROM cars;
    ```
    - Nice! Can you see how convenient using SQLAlchemy is?
    - Not only processing data in Python was more accessible, but it also made it easier to write tables to the database

<br>

- __`[CHANGE SCENE] Full screen Webcam`__
    - Now you know how to connect Python to a database
    - First, we used the API called `psycopg2` to connect to the database
    - This API is specific to PostgreSQL, and it establishes a connection to the database as well as allowing us to make requests to it
    - However, if you want to make things easier, you can use SQLAlchemy which get rids of the need to write long queries
    - Both options are valid, and as with many other tools, make sure you are using the correct one!
