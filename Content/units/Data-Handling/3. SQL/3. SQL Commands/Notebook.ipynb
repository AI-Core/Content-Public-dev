    "*SQL (Structured Query Language)* commands are used to interact with and manipulate data in a relational database. SQL is a programming language specifically designed for managing data in relational databases, and it is used by a wide range of applications, from small personal databases to large enterprise-level systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of SQL commands, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">*Data Definition Language (DDL)*</b> commands, which are used to define the database schema (e.g: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">*Data Manipulation Language (DML)*</b> commands, which are used to manipulate the data stored in the database (e.g: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">*Data Control Language (DCL)*</b> commands, which are used to control access to the data stored in the database (e.g: `GRANT` and `REVOKE`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">*Data Query Language (DQL)*</b> commands, that are used to retrieve data from the database (e.g: `SELECT`, `SELECT INTO`, and `SELECT DISTINCT`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">*Transaction Control Language (TCL)*</b> commands, are used to manage the changes made by Data Manipulation Language (**DML**) statements. **TCL** commands allow you to control the changes made to the data in a database by allowing you to commit or rollback those changes. The three main TCL commands are `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` and `SAVEPOINT`.\n",

    "The SQL *order of execution* will be different to that of other programming languages, such as Python, where each line of code is executed sequentially. With SQL, queries are executed in a predefined order and understanding the order can often help you understand why your SQL query won't run. \n",
    "\n",
    "The order of execution of SQL statements is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">FROM</b>: The table(s) specified in the `FROM` clause are joined and the resulting rows are filtered based on the conditions in the `WHERE` clause\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">JOIN</b>: The tables specified in the `JOIN` clause are combined, with each row from the first table being matched with any corresponding rows from the second table\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">WHERE</b>: The conditions specified in the `WHERE` clause are used to filter the rows from the result set of the `JOIN` operation\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">GROUP BY</b>: The rows are grouped based on the columns specified in the `GROUP BY` clause, and aggregate functions (such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc.) are applied to the groups\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">HAVING</b>: The conditions specified in the `HAVING` clause are used to filter the groups from the result set of the `GROUP BY` operation\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">SELECT</b>: The columns specified in the `SELECT` clause are retrieved from the result set of the `HAVING` operation\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">DISTINCT</b>: The duplicate rows are removed from the result set of the `SELECT` operation\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">ORDER BY</b>: The result set is sorted based on the columns specified in the `ORDER BY` clause\n",
