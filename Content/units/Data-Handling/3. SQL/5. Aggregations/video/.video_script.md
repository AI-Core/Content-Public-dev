## COUNT

- an aggregation is the name for any operation that combines values over different records, such as
- summing up values of a column

```
SELECT SUM(length) FROM film
```

- Averaging values over a column

```
SELECT AVG(*) FROM film
```

- taking a maximum or minimum value over a column

```
SELECT MAX(length) FROM film
```

- notice that each of these queries just returns a single record, because the columns returned are aggregates of all rows 

- an interesting one is the count aggregate function
- it counts the non-null entries in a column

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film
```

- if you pass in every column using the asterisk, it will return you the number of records in the result

```
SELECT COUNT(rating) FROM film
```

- there are loads of other use cases where you may want to aggregate records in a different way... you just need to look it up
- you also need to make sure that the function works for your data type
- if we try to sum over some text it's not going to make sense

```
SELECT SUM(title) FROM film
```

_Look up postgres average_

- Often you also want to group certain records together and perform aggregations over just those groups
- for example, you may want to group the records by user_id, and then count the number of records for each user
- to do this, you can use the GROUP BY keywords followed by the column names that you want to group by

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film GROUP BY rating
```

- here we can't see which rating each count corresponds to, so we should select out that column too

```
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) FROM film GROUP BY rating
```

- but you can't select any columns which have been aggregated over

```
SELECT title, rating, COUNT(*) FROM film GROUP BY rating
```

- this gives us an error because the aggregated record doesn't have a defined title - it's the combination of many titles


## Multiple columns
- you can also group on multiple columns

```
SELECT rental_rate, rating, COUNT(*) FROM FILM GROUP BY rental_rate, rating
```

# HAVING
- similar to how we can filter rows using the WHERE keyword, we can filter the result of aggregations using the HAVING keyword, followed by a condition

- the difference between WHERE and HAVING is that WHERE is for filtering out rows before they have been aggregated, and HAVING is for filtering our rows after they have been aggregated

```
SELECT rental_rate, rating, COUNT(*) FROM FILM GROUP BY rental_rate, rating
HAVING COUNT(*) > 60
```

- here is one of the places where the order of execution and the order that you write the queries becomes important
- you might have aliased a column in your select clause, but because the select clause is actually the last operation to run, the having clause won't be able to use that name to reference it

```
SELECT rental_rate, rating, COUNT(*) FROM FILM GROUP BY rental_rate, rating
HAVING COUNT(*) > 60
```

- Those are the basics of aggregations in SQL

## FLOW CONTROL

```
SELECT title, release_year, rental_rate, 
CASE 
 WHEN rental_rate > 0 AND rental_rate < 2.99 THEN 'discount' 
 WHEN rental_rate >= 2.99 AND rental_rate < 4.99 THEN 'regular' 
 ELSE 'premium' 
END AS quality
