    "> Unlike traditional aggregate functions that work on entire datasets, *window functions* offer a more nuanced approach to analysis by focusing on a specific subset of data. They operate within a defined 'window' of rows, a concept achieved through three fundamental mechanisms: *partitioning*, *ordering*, and *framing*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Partitioning** \n",
    "    - Divides the dataset into distinct groups or partitions based on specific criteria\n",
    "    - Within each partition, window functions will operate independently, performing calculations on the rows within that group\n",
    "    - For example: in a sales dataset, partitioning by product category would enable separate calculations of metrics such as sales performance for each category\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ordering**\n",
    "    - Establishes a sequence for the rows within the partition, providing context and direction to the calculations performed by window functions\n",
    "    - By defining a specific order, analysts can uncover data patterns and trends\n",
    "    - Continuing with the sales examples, ordering by date would enable the calculation of cumulative sales over time, revealing insights into sales trends and seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Framing**\n",
    "    - Determines which rows are included in the calculation at any given point. It defines the boundaries of the window of rows within which window functions operate.\n",
    "    - The mechanism allows for dynamic analysis, where the window can shift or remain fixed based on specified criteria\n",
    "    - For instance, framing can be used to compute moving averages over a rolling window of the past N days, providing insights into short-term trends\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these three mechanisms enable SQL users to conduct complex analyses that go beyond simple aggregations."

    "\n",
    "In this section we will look at some common window functions and their unique functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`\n",
    "\n",
    "These are traditional aggregate functions in SQL, but when used as window functions, they operate on a set of rows defined by the window rather than the entire dataset. They enable the calculation of running totals, averages, maximums, minimums over a specific subset of data within partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `LEAD()` and `LAG()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LEAD()` and `LAG()` function sallow access to data from subsequent or preceding rows within a partition, respectively. They are commonly used to compare current row values with those of adjacent rows or to calculate difference over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "`LEAD()` allows you to retrieve the value of a column from the next row, while `LAG()` retrieve the value from the previous row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a sales dataset where you want to calculate the difference in sales amount between consecutive days:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    sales_date,\n",
    "    sales_amount,\n",
    "    LEAD(sales_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sales_date) - sales_amount AS sales_difference\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    sales_data;\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `LEAD(sales_amount)` retrieves the sales amount from the next row, allowing you to calculate the difference, `sales_difference`, between consecutive days. Similarly, you can use `LAG()` to compare the current's row sales amount with the previous day's sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `ROW_NUMBER()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is a fundamental window function that assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within a partition based on the specified ordering criteria. It provides a simple way to enumerate rows, which is particularly useful for ranking and pagination tasks. Each row receives a distinct number starting from 1 for the first row in the partition, incrementing by 1 for each subsequent row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a scenario where you want to assign a unique identified to each customer order in a sales dataset:\n",

    "```\n",

Each order receives a distinct number starting from 1 for the earliest order date, incrementing by 1 for each subsequent order. This provides a simple way to enumerate orders based on their chronological order, facilitating tasks such as ranking or identifying the first order for each customer."
