# SQL Basics
# TODO mention semicolon ends statement
# TODO describe that highlighting SQL and running runs only that SQL

## Relational databases
- Relational databases consist of tables that have some relationship to one another
- they typically contain a specific entity and are named after it with a noun in lower case

_Open the pagila db in pgadmin_

- in the pagila database, under the schemas, you can see the names of such tables
- to query the information stored in these tables, we use structured query language, or SQL, which is commonly pronounced "Sequel"

_Open the query tool_

- i'll open up the query tool
- and write the most simple SQL query I can

_Write SELECT * FROM film_

- this query selects every column from the table called film

_Highlight the asterisk_

- the asterisk represents every column

_Highlight the query_

- we would call this a SQL query or SQL statement
- they can get a lot more complicated, as we will see

_Switch to webcam_

- SQL is the current industry standard for querying structured data
- it's very fast, much faster than Python, as it's extremely well optimised for querying data
- and it allows us to very easily query any part of the data using a simple syntax
- like the storage, the engine which runs the SQL queries is part of the database software, so we often call them SQL databases
- there are many other alternative SQL databases similar to postgresQL, including SQL Server, MySQL or SQLite
- they all work in roughly the same way, so you don't need to worry about getting familiar with all of them

_Switch to screen capture_ 

- SQL queries are case insensitive, but it's best practice to uppercase every SQL keyword to distinguish them from your data
- the different parts of the query are often called clauses

_Highlight the select clause and the from clause in turn_

- so you might talk about the select clause or the from clause

- When I run the query by hitting F5 the result is shown below
- this query just returns everything in the table

## Rows and Columns
- tables have rows and columns
- each row represents one record - usually one of the entities which the table is named after
- each column represents a particular attribute for the records in a table

- you can select out just specific columns using their name

_Select title from film_

- you can select multiple by separating them with a comma
- they are returned in the same order you specify

- the "primary key" is the attribute of a table which is unique for every record it contains
- it's typically a UUID or an integer index

## Entity Relationship Diagrams
- often tables relate to each other
- entity relationship diagrams, or ERDs, show the names of the tables, their columns, and the relationships between them
- tables can have one to one relationships, one to many or many to many
- you can see a many relationship by the forked symbol which is known as a crows foot

## foreign keys
- sometimes the primary key of one table appears in another table, where it is not a primary key
- an example would be the customer id in the rental table
- this customer id is not unique in this table because a single customer may have many rentals, so it can't be the primary key
- a primary key of one table, that appears in a different table, is known as a "foreign key"
- so the customer id is a foreign key of the rental table

## Normalisation
- why is everything split up like this?
- why not keep it simple and just have a single table which contains records for with both user and actor 
- there are a few reasons
- if we stored the users name in every rental record, we would be storing the same information in multiple places
- this is going to take up more memory and probably cost more
- it also means that if the user changes their name, we will have to update it in many places rather than just once in the user table

- splitting data up into tables like this to avoid redundancy is known as database normalization

## Composite keys
- take a look here...

_Show the film actors table_

- the film id is shared between the film table and the film actors table, which contains the actors in each film
- notice here that the same actor might show up in multiple movies, and that movies contain multiple actors
- so the primary key in this case is actually a combination of those two ids together
- we call this a composite key
- here in turn the film_actor table links to the actor table

## where

- you can filter on any column using the WHERE keyword

_SELECT * FROM film WHERE release_year = 2006

- notice that a single equals sign is used for comparison, unlike in python
- you can also use arithmetic operators like

_Show %, *, -, /_

- And other conditional operators

_Replace = with <, >, <=, and >=_

- and logical operators

## AND 

## OR

- and membership operators

_Show using list ('a', 'b')_

- notice that lists in SQL use round brackets


## LIKE

- you can use the LIKE keyword to do a sort of regular expression matching

_SELECT * FROM film WHERE name LIKE 'A%'

- here the percentage sign is a wildcard for zero or more of any character
- so this query finds all films whose name starts with A

- an underscore is a wildcard for one of any character

## BETWEEN

_SELECT * FROM film WHERE length BETWEEN 100 AND 110

## NOT

- you can also negate any conditional with a NOT keyword

_SELECT * FROM film WHERE NOT rating = 'PG'_

- notice that single quotes are used, not double quotes

## Limit

- to limit the number of results you can use the limit

_SELECT * FROM film LIMIT 3_

## Order by

_SELECT * FROM film ORDER BY _

## TODO order of writing operations vs order they are run

## Outro
- That's enough to get started with SQL
