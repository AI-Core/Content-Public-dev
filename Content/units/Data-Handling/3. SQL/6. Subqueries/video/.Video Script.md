    - One powerful tool in SQL is Subqueries. 
    - Subqueries are a way to query data from a table that in turn is queried from another table.
    - Put it in another way, subqueries are a query inside another query
    - We will see that the way to make a query to the output of another query is by using a JOIN, WHERE, or with Common Table Expressions, or CTE for short.
    - Let's take a look at some images to get an idea of how this works.

<br>

- __`[CHANGE SCENE] OPEN KEYNOTE .SQL_Subqueries.key`__
    - This image roughly shows the idea of a subquery
    - First we make a subquery to the original table, obtaining an intermediate table
    - Then we make another query to that intermediate table, obtaining the final table
    - And it's as simple as that!

<br>

- __`[CHANGE SCENE] NEXT SLIDE`__
    - Another way to visualize it is to think that the intermediate table is a nested query
    - The reason for representing it this way is that you will shortly see that the query in SQL looks something similar
    - So, we have an outer query that is retrieving data from the intermediate table
    - And the intermediate table is obtained from the inner query
    - So, with this in mind, let's take a look at the SQL queries that allow us to do this

<br>

- __`[CHANGE SCENE] OPEN pgAdmin4`__
    - Let's use our favorite database, Pagila
    - As mentioned earlier, a subquery can be done using JOIN, WHERE, or CTE
    - Let's see how to do this with JOIN, more specifically, an INNER JOIN
    - The INNER JOIN returns the rows that are common to both tables
    - So, let's use the JOIN clause to check films belonging to the 'Drama' category
    - The syntax for a subquery using JOIN is as follows:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM table1
    JOIN (
        SELECT * FROM table2
    ) AS table2
    ON table1.column = table2.column
    ```
    - Notice that we are basically doing the same as what we would be doing with a simple JOIN, but instead of using the table name, we are using a subquery
    - We are also giving a name to the subquery, so that we can refer to it later
    - Ok, so let's see what this looks for our particular example:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM film_category fc
    JOIN (
            SELECT * FROM category
            WHERE name = 'Drama'
        ) AS ca
    ON fc.category_id = ca.category_id;
    ```
    - We are not done just yet, we need to add another JOIN to get the names of the films
    - So, the output we just obtained is actually an intermediate table that we can use to make another query
    - So, the query we just made can be nested into an outer query like this:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM film
    JOIN (
        SELECT * FROM film_category fc
        JOIN (
            SELECT * FROM category
            WHERE name = 'Drama'
        ) AS ca
        ON fc.category_id = ca.category_id
    ) AS fc
    ON film.film_id = fc.film_id;
    ```
    - Nice, isn't it? __`[SCROLL TO THE RIGHT]`__ If we scroll to the right, we can only see that category is equal to 'Drama'
    - We can also perform subqueries using WHERE
    - Remember that WHERE is a clause that is used to filter the rows of a table
    - So we can use that property to filter the rows that appear in the output of the subquery
    - Using the same example, let's see first the film_ids that belong to the 'Drama' category:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM film_category
    WHERE category_id IN (
        SELECT category_id FROM category
        WHERE name = 'Drama'
    );
    ```
    - Looking good! Let's take a look at what happens behind the scenes
    - The inner query looks like this:
    ```
    SELECT category_id FROM category
    WHERE name = 'Drama'
    ```
    - And, as you can see from the output, we only get a number: 7
    - The outer query then would look like this:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM film_category
    WHERE category_id IN (7)
    ```
    - Which is the same as the query we just made. 
    - Once again, we are not done just yet. We can use another WHERE clause to filter the rows of the film table with those values that are present in the film_id in the output we just obtained
    - And, once again, the outer query can nest the query we just made inside it:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM film
    WHERE film_id IN (
        SELECT film_id FROM film_category
        WHERE category_id IN (
            SELECT category_id FROM category
            WHERE name = 'Drama'
        )
    );
    ```
    - We can check whether the current output is the same as the one we made using JOINs
    - In this case, we have 62 rows, let's check the one with JOIN:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM film
    JOIN (
        SELECT * FROM film_category fc
        JOIN (
            SELECT * FROM category
            WHERE name = 'Drama'
        ) AS ca
        ON fc.category_id = ca.category_id
    ) AS fc
    ON film.film_id = fc.film_id;
    ```
    - And, yes, we have the same number of rows. However, the output is not identical, because in the JOIN operation, we are retrieving all the columns, whereas when we use WHERE, we are only retrieving the columns present in the film table
    - Let's check another way to make subqueries, in this case, using Common Table Expressions or CTE
    - They start with the word WITH and create a temporary table that can be used in the query
    - The general syntax is as follows:
    ```
    WITH table_name AS (
        SELECT query
    )

    SELECT * FROM table_name;
    ```
    - Sounds easy, right? Let's start with a simple example to understand how it works
    - The first example is going again to get the film_ids that belong to the 'Drama', 'Comedy', or 'Animation' category:
    ```
    WITH cat_film AS (
        SELECT category_id FROM category
        WHERE name IN ('Drama', 'Comedy', 'Animation')
    )

    SELECT * FROM film_category
    WHERE category_id IN (
        SELECT category_id FROM cat_film
    );
    ```
    - Seems that it worked alright. Let's see what happened under the hood
    - The query inside the CTE returns the following:
    ```
    SELECT category_id FROM category
    WHERE name IN ('Drama', 'Comedy', 'Animation');
    ```
    - The output returns the numbers 2, 5, and 7
    - So basically it creates a temporary table with these numbers, and then we can use them in another query
    - Let's keep going and get the titles of the films that belong to these categories:
    ```
    WITH cat_film AS (
        SELECT category_id FROM category
        WHERE name IN ('Drama', 'Comedy', 'Animation')
    )
    
    SELECT * FROM film
    WHERE film_id IN (
        SELECT film_id FROM film_category
        WHERE category_id IN (
            SELECT category_id FROM cat_film
        )
    );
    ```
    - Observe the SELECT query, we are not actually saving a lot of lines of code, but it makes things more understandable
    - We can easily understand the content of the cat_film table, so then it is easier how to make the subquery
    - The final thing I want to show is UNION
    - UNION is a clause that allows us to combine the results of two or more queries
    - It might seem similar to JOIN, but while the JOIN statement merges the columns of the tables, the UNION statement merges the rows of the tables
    - It is not exactly a subquery, but it can be seen as one, since it joins the output of two or more queries
    - The syntax for a UNION is as follows:
    ```
    (SELECT query_1)
    UNION
    (SELECT query_2)
    ```
    - And that's it!
    - Let's see an example where we can see the rows of the film table that has a rating of G, or a replacement cost of 10.99
    ```
    (
    SELECT * FROM film
    WHERE rating = 'G'
    )
    UNION
    (
    SELECT * FROM film
    WHERE replacement_cost = 10.99
    );
    ```
    - Be careful, when you make each query, they must have the same number of columns.
    - Also, if they have the same number of columns, the data types of the columns must be the same.
    - So for example, if we write:
    ```
    (
    SELECT title, rating FROM film
    WHERE rating = 'G'
    )
    UNION
    (
    SELECT title, replacement_cost FROM film
    WHERE replacement_cost = 10.99
    );
    ```
    - This will throw an error, because the column rating has a different data type than the column replacement_cost

    - You learned the concept of subqueries
    - Subqueries make it possible to perform complex queries
    - It works by dividing the query into smaller parts, so everything is easier to understand
    - You could see that we could use JOINs, WHEREs, CTEs, and UNIONs to perform complex queries
    - Depending on the problem, you might want to use one or another
    - But ultimately, subqueries is a tool that is always useful
    - So make sure you have them in your toolkit!
