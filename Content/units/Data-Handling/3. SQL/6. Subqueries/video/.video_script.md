- when you run a select query, it returns the results in the form of a table
- this table can actually be used within another query, in the same way as any other table

```
SELECT *  
FROM actor 
WHERE actor_id IN  
 ( 
    SELECT actor_id  
    FROM film_actor 
    WHERE film_id = 2
)
```

- we simply put the query within brackets in our current query
- we call this a subquery

_Highlight the subquery_

- you can perform nested subqueries too

```
SELECT *  
FROM actor 
WHERE actor_id IN  
 ( 
    SELECT actor_id  
    FROM film_actor 
    WHERE film_id = 
        (
            SELECT film_id FROM film  
            WHERE title = 'DRAGON SQUAD'
        ) 
)
```

- and these can be as deeply nested as you want

## DERIVED SUQUERIES
- when we select FROM a subquery, we call it a derived subquery

```
SELECT AVG(a) FROM  
 ( 
 SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS a 
 FROM payment 
 GROUP BY customer_id 
 ) AS totals; 
```

- derived subqueries have to have an alias


## CTEs
- sometimes it would be convenient to be able to define a table first and then refer back to it
- this can help make youre queries more readable, and also avoid having to repeat that definition
- to do this, we simply follow the WITH keyword by an alias, and then a subquery
- then we can refer to the result of this subquery using the alias later 

```
WITH total_amounts AS ( 
(SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS a 
   FROM payment 
   GROUP BY customer_id) 
) 
 
SELECT AVG(a) 
FROM total_amounts;
```

- we call these common table expressions, or CTEs
