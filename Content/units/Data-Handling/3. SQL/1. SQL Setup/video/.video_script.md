- Here, we're going to set up a SQL database called PostgreSQL and a database administration tool called Pgadmin

## What is postgres?
- postgres is a relational database server software
- when your computer is running postgres it is running some code which listens to commands from you and uses them to edit some stored information 
- these relational databases consist of tables which have rows and columns
- typically each row represents a single record such as a single user
- and each column represents a single attribute of the users
- the information that these kinds of tables are able to store must be 
- this kind of storage is excellent for performing efficient, fast queries, and analytics on
- and SQL, or structured query language, is used to write the commands that do that
- we'll get deeper into this later

## What is pgadmin?
- it can be cumbersome to interact with the database through a terminal
- your terminal doesn't even run SQL - it probably runs bash
- pgadmin essentially provides a user interface for doing so, and acts as a kind of development environment for writing SQL

## Disclaimer - not setting up here and windows is bad
- installing these things is one place where windows tends to produce significantly more difficult to debug issues compared to other systems
- the steps are quite different for linux compared to other systems
- I've already got it installed, and it's pretty easy to do on mac anyway, so I'm not going to demo this part in detail
- there are detailed notes in the portal explaining how to do this for each system, and how to overcome common issues
- but the basic idea is as usual...
- search online to install each of them and follow the steps

## Installing postgres

## 
- Once postgres is running your the database server locally, you can connect to it using pgadmin
- note that the database certainly doesn't have to be running on your machine
- in a professional environment it will almost certainly be running on a remote computer in the cloud, but you would connect to it in exactly the same way, as follows
- when you first set up pgadmin you'll have to set a master password which limits access to everything you have set up on pgadmin - which could be multiple different databases
- once you're past that you can see the different databases you've already set up
- in your case there probably won't be any
- to connect to a new database you can right click the servers
- give it a logical name
- specify the IP address of the machine you want to connect to
- if it's running locally you can specify this machine with either what is known as the loopback address 127.0.0.1 or the name localhost which corresponds the same thing
- then make sure that you're connecting to the right port on your machine - this is the particular interface on your machine where the postgres server code is listening for commands
- by default postgres always uses port 5432
- you'll also need to specify the user and password that you created when you set up the database

## Exploring the db
- once you're here you can see all of the details of your database
- we just connected to a particular database on a particular server
- note that a single server could be running multiple databases 
- within the database that I just created you can find the schemas section
- this will contain information about what tables exist and what data they contain
- for the moment it's empty
- what we want to be able to do is to write SQL commands to query and manipulate our data
- to open up the SQL editor you can use by clicking this button
- you need to have a part of a database tree selected on the left to do this though
- a common mistake is finding that this button is greyed out because pgadmin doesn't know which database you want to write queries to

## Let's 
- we're going to set up the Pagilia database - a typical example database to get started with
- you can find the pagila database files online or in the AiCore Portal
- download them so we can restore our database with them
- you can create a new database by right clicking on the databases part of the tree
- so I'll call it pagila and leave all of the other settings
- then we can right click it to restore it
- find that tar file and select it
- pgadmin will start putting those files into the new database
- then you can refresh the list of tables in the schemas and see the tables

- a typical confusion is not seeing new tables in there because the UI hasn't updated
- it's usually a simple case of just right clicking and then refreshing that part of the tree

- now we're ready to write SQL
