- create, read, update, and delete
- these are the only operations that you need to do to manipulate or analyse data in a database
- that's why they have their own acronym: CRUD
- each of these operations, which may pass information between a user and a database, is known as a transaction
- and most databases are known as transactional databases

## ACID
- a transactional database satisfies 4 conditions that have the acronym ACID

- Atomicity
- Consistency
- Isolation
- Durability

- Atomicity means that each operation is atomic. It either completes or it doesn't. It's called being atomic because heres nothing smaller than it.
- consistency means that the state of the database logically before and after the transaction
- isolation means that one transaction cannot affect another. they are totally independent
- durability means that changes will persist even in the event of the system having to be restarted

- when the conditions are satisfied we say refer to the CRUD database transactions as ACID transactions

## 
- before we start performing these CRUD operations on our data, we might need to actually create, update or delete tables themselves
- here, i'm in a totally blank database

- you can create a table using the CREATE TABLE statement followed by the table name, then the columns, separated by commas
- the spec for each column must at least include the name and the datatype

```
CREATE TABLE movies ( 
    id INT,
    title VARCHAR,
    length INT
);
```
- notice that the columns are separated by commas, but not the name and datatype

- the types i've used here are an integer
- and a varchar which is a varying length sequence of characters

- if you want to delete a table you can use the DROP keyword

```
DROP TABLE movies
```

- dropping a table would delete all the data inside though - be careful with that
- rather than dropping a table, you can alter it using the ALTER KEYWORD
- alter can do all kinds of things from add columns to changing their type etc

```
ALTER TABLE movies ADD COLUMN release_year INT 
```

- what comes after the column keyword is the same as I put in the create table statement

- you can find all of the detail about these commands in the docs
- let's check them out quickly and understand how to read them and use them to implement whatever you want, without having me show you

_Open up the docs by searching postgres create table_

- you can add constraints to the column
- you can also specify the length of the character sequence when you create a table

```
CREATE TABLE movies ( 
    id INT,
    title VARCHAR(30),
    length INT
);
```

- you can also specify the constraints of this column such as
- whether it can contain null values

```
CREATE TABLE movies ( 
    id INT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    length INT NOT NULL
);
```
- or whether it must be unique

```
CREATE TABLE movies ( 
    id INT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    length INT NOT NULL
);
```

- you can create checks for each column too

```
CREATE TABLE movies ( 
    id INT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    length INT NOT NULL CHECK (length > 0)
);
```

- you can even give a name to a constraint so that error messages are descriptive
- to do so you use the keyword constraint, followed by a name of the constraint before the check

```
CREATE TABLE movies ( 
    id INT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    length INT NOT NULL CONSTRAINT is_positive CHECK (length > 0)
);
```

- and the final thing I'll mention about creating tables is that you can specify the primary key as such

```
CREATE TABLE movies ( 
    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    length INT NOT NULL CONSTRAINT is_positive CHECK (length > 0)
);
```

- you can add all of these constraints in a similar way when using the alter statment too

- now we can create, read, update, and delete tables
- we just to look at how we can do the same CRUD operations on individual records in those tables

## Records
- Let me show you how to find this out if you didn't know

### Create - Insert
_Open the insert docs by searching "postgres create entry"_

- creating records is done with the INSERT keyword
- for example, to insert an item into a table

_INSERT INTO movies VALUES (4, '2001: A Space Odyssey', 149)_

- you can also specify exactly what columns you want to populate with each value by specifying the names of the columns in that order in parentheses after the table name

_INSERT INTO movies (id, title, length) VALUES (4, '2001: A Space Odyssey', 149)_

- doing this means you can insert only some of the values for a record
- or you can pass them in with a different order

### Read - SELECT
- we've already seen this, but the select clause is used to read data

_SELECT * FROM movies_

### Update - UPDATE

- Now let's look up how to update a record

_Open the update docs by searching "postgres update"_

- you can use the UPDATE keyword as such

_UPDATE movies SET length = 160 WHERE title = '2001: A Space Odyssey'_

- Don't forget the WHERE clause 
- be careful with SQL commands and that WHERE clause though
- it's easy to define it just too loosely and update way more records than you intended
- and there's no undo button

_Laugh_

- you can update multiple columns at once too by using multiple SET clauses one after another

_UPDATE movies SET length = 160 SET id = 45 WHERE title = '2001: A Space Odyssey'_

### Delete

_Open the delete docs_

- You can DELETE records by writing...

_DELETE FROM movies WHERE name = '2001: A Space Odyssey'_

- these are the basics of every operation that you will need to perform as you use SQL in the real world
