    - There are four basic operations that you can perform in a database:
        - Create
        - Read
        - Update
        - Delete
    - Which constitute the CRUD operations
    - In this video, we will focus on three of these four operations: Create, Update, and Delete
    - Each operation has a different syntax, so we will review each one in detail
    - Let's start with the Create operation

- __`[CHANGE SCENE] Open pgAdmin4`__
    - Creating tables is a simple task, and you can create a table from scratch or from an existing table
    - Let's start creating a table from scratch
    - When creating a new table, you need to specify the name of the table and the name of the columns in the table
    - So, the syntax for creating a table is:
    ```
    CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
        <column_name> <data_type> <constraint>
    );
    ```
    - It is important to note the parentheses to denote the contents of the table
    - Something you are probably wondering is what is the data type or the constraint?
    - The data type indicates the values that the column can take
    - It can either be an integer, a character, date and time, or a boolean for example
    - The constraint indicates the rules that the column must follow
    - With constraints we can force the column to be unique, not null, or a primary key for example
    - So, let's see an example of a table with a single column first
    - The table will contain a column named `test_id` with a data type of `integer` and a constraint of `not null`
    - So, the syntax for creating a table is:
    ```
    CREATE TABLE test_1 (
        test_id INT NOT NULL
    );
    ```
    - We can take a look at the created table running the following command:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM test_1;
    ```
    - Notice that the table is empty, we will see how to populate the table in the shortly
    - For now, let's focus on creating tables
    - Let's create another table called `test_2`, in this case with three columns, `test_id`, `test_name`, and `test_age`, in this case, the data type of the columns are `integer`, a variable length `character`, and `integer`, and the constraints are `primary key`, `not null`, and `not null` respectively.
    - In addition, we will add another constraint to `test_age` to make sure that the age is between 0 and 100
    - To do so, we can use the `CHECK` constraint, which is added to the end of the column definition and is used to check that the values in the column are meet certain conditions
    - So, the syntax for creating a table is:
    ```
    CREATE TABLE test_2 (
        test_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        test_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        test_age INT NOT NULL CHECK (test_age BETWEEN 0 AND 100)
    );
    ```
    - VARCHAR is a variable length character, and the number in the parentheses is the maximum length of the string
    - You can add additional constraints to the table by adding them to the end of the table definition
    - For example, let's say that all the names in the table must be at least 3 characters long
    - The query to do so is:
    ```
    CREATE TABLE test_3 (
        test_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        test_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        test_age INT NOT NULL CHECK (test_age BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
        CHECK (LENGTH(test_name) >= 3)
    );
    ```
    - Make sure to check to documentation for more information on data types and constraints
    - There is another way to create tables which uses existing tables as a basis for the new table
    - The new table is going to get the output of a `SELECT` query from the existing table.
    - For example, we are in the Pagila database, and we want to create a table called `test_4` that contains the customers whose first name starts with the letter `J`
    - The syntax for the `SELECT` query would be:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM customer 
    WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%';
    ```
    - So the syntax for creating a table is:
    ```
    CREATE TABLE test_4 AS (
        SELECT * FROM customer
        WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%'
    );
    ```
    - If we run the following query:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM test_4;
    ```
    - We will see that the table contains the same columns as the customer table, but only the customers whose first name starts with the letter `J`
    - Great, so we know how to create tables, however, if we create empty tables, they are quite useless
    - So, let's see the next operation in the CRUD operations: Update
    - Updating a table means that we can add or remove columns and/or rows from the table, or change the values of existing columns
    - Operations on columns have a different syntax from operations on rows. Let's take a look first at how to add or remove columns
    - For both operations, we use the command `ALTER TABLE`, followed by the name of the table, and then the operation
    - For adding columns, we use the command `ADD` followed by the name of the column, and then the data type of the column
    - For example, let's say we want to add the column `test_name` to the `table_1` with the data type `character`
    - The syntax for adding a column is:
    ```
    ALTER TABLE table_1 
    ADD test_name VARCHAR(255);
    ```
    - We can check if the column has been added by using a SELECT query:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM table_1;
    ```
    - Great! It looks like it worked as expected
    - For removing columns, we use the command `DROP` followed by the name of the column, so let's remove the column we just added:
    ```
    ALTER TABLE table_1
    DROP test_name;
    ```
    - Let's check if the column is still there:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM table_1;
    ```
    - Good, it looks like it is gone!
    - Now, let's take a look at how to add or remove rows
    - For adding rows, we use the command `INSERT INTO` followed by the name of the table, and then the name or names of the columns that we want to insert values into, and then the values that we want to insert
    - For example, let's say we want to add a row to the table `table_2` with the values `1`, `'John'`, and `30`
    - The query would look like:
    ```
    INSERT INTO table_2 (test_id, test_name, test_age)
    VALUES (1, 'John', 30);
    ```
    - Let's see if the row has been added:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM table_2;
    ```
    - It looks like it has been added!
    - Lastly, for the update operation, we can also change the values of existing cells
    - To do so, we can use the command `UPDATE` followed by the name of the table, then the keyword `SET` followed by the column and the value we want to set, and finally the condition where we want to update the values
    - Be careful here, if you don't add the condition, all the rows will be updated with the same value
    - Let's take a look at the `test_4` table to see an example of how to update a row:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM test_4;
    ```
    - Ok, so the first row's first name is Jennifer, let's change it to JANE:
    ```
    UPDATE test_4
    SET first_name = 'JANE'
    WHERE first_name = 'JENNIFER';
    SELECT * FROM test_4;
    ```
    - __`[SCROLL DOWN TO THE BOTTOM]`__ If you go to the bottom of the table, you will see that the first name has been changed to JANE
    - As mentioned, if you don't add a condition, all the rows will be updated with the same value
    ```
    UPDATE test_4
    SET first_name = 'JANE';
    SELECT * FROM test_4;
    ```
    - Not good, all the values in first_name have been changed to JANE. So be careful when using the UPDATE command!
    - The last operation in the CRUD operations is Delete
    - We already saw how to remove columns, but what about removing rows?
    - For removing rows, we use the command `DELETE FROM` followed by the name of the table, and then the condition that we want to delete rows that meet
    - Be careful, if you don't add a condition, all the rows will be deleted!
    - For example, let's take a look at `test_4`:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM test_4;
    ```
    - Ok, so let's remove all the rows whose store_id is `1`
    ```
    DELETE FROM test_4
    WHERE store_id = 1;
    SELECT * FROM test_4;
    ```
    - Great, so we have removed all the rows that have store_id `1`
    - As mentioned, if we don't add a condition, all the rows will be deleted
    ```
    DELETE FROM test_4;
    SELECT * FROM test_4;
    ```
    - And now the table is completely empty, so once again, be careful when you use the `DELETE FROM` command!
    - Additionally, you can also delete the whole table by using the command `DROP TABLE` followed by the name of the table
    - For example, let's delete the `test_4` table:
    ```
    DROP TABLE test_4;
    ```
    - If now you want to retrieve data from the `test_4` table, you will get an error because that table doesn't exist anymore!

    - So now you know how to create, update, and delete tables in the database
    - When creating a table, you can create a table from scratch, or you can create it based on an existing table
    - When you update a table, you can update it column or row-wise
    - And similarly, when you delete a table, you can delete it column or row-wise
    - Bear in mind that some commands, such as `UPDATE` and `DELETE FROM` can impact the whole table if you don't add a condition
    - With this, you already know how to perform the four basic operations in the CRUD group of operations
