# JOINS

- JOINS are a type of operation that we can use to combine data from different tables

_show ERD diagram_

- our ERD shows us how the tables in the pagila database relate

- if we wanted to find the cities in our database that are in the UK, then we can't just look at the city table, because that doesn't have a readable country name, only a country id
- so we need to JOIN those tables before we do a filter
- when we do that, SQL will need to know which rows correspond to which others

- so we have to tell it which columns in each table need to match for two rows to be joined
- these records will be joined together and then returned as a record in the output

```
SELECT * 
FROM country 
JOIN city 
ON country.country_id = city.country_id 
WHERE country = 'United Kingdom';
```

- we simply put the keyword JOIN between the tables we want to join
- then specify on which columns there needs to be a match
- because tables often contain columns with the same name, you need to specify the column of which table you're referring too by using it's name as a prefix, followed by a dot

- you can use the same approach to select columns out of the joined table

## Nested JOINS
- if we wanted to find the addresses of our stores or users in a particular country, then we would need to join our previous result to another table - the address table

```
SELECT * 
FROM address 
JOIN city 
ON address.city_id = city.city_id 
JOIN country 
ON city.country_id = country.country_id  
WHERE country = 'United Kingdom';
```

- this is an example of a double JOIN
- there is no limit on how nested a join can be

## Different types of JOIN
- what we've just used is called an inner join
- the only records in the resulting table are those from each table which had a match in the column we joined them on
- other entries were discarded

- there are other types of JOINs too

- the sytax for writing them is basically the same
- you simply specify the name of the type of JOIN before the JOIN keyword
- you can even explicitly write INNER JOIN... this is the default if you don't specify
