    ">Views are database objects that take the form of virtual tables, acting like shortcuts to regularly used queries.  You can save a query as a view, so that rather than repeatedly typing out the same query structure, you can just refer to the view instead. Once created and stored, views can be used in any subsequent query. They provide a way to encapsulate frequently-used logic into reusable elements, making your queries more DRY."
