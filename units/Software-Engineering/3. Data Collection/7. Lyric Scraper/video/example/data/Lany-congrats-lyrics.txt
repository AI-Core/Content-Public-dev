[Verse 1]
I hope you're throwing a party
I hope you're feeling yourself
I know it won't but the icing
On your cake should say
26 going on 12


[Pre-Chorus]
Round of applause
You got what you want
10
10

[Chorus]
You broke my fucking heart
You tore my world apart
Went so low, I didn't know
That you were capable of that
So here's to all the times
You made me want to cry
Got your way, so celebrate
And pat yourself on the back

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, congrats
Congrats

[Verse 2]
I hope you're popping some bottles
I hope you're out on the town
If I were you I'd be watching
What I say 'cause
What goes around, comes back around

[Pre-Chorus]
You lie through your teeth
Tell me how do you sleep?

[Chorus]
Knowing you broke my fucking heart
You tore my world apart
Went so low, I didn't know
That you were capable of that
So here's to all the times
You made me want to cry
Got your way, so celebrate
And pat yourself on the back
