[Chorus]
I'm not nor will I ever be your babycakes

But I got everythin' that's criminal
Put me in the sun, so then I melt
I can cast off the evil eye sent my way
I'm not nor will I ever be your babycakes

But I got everythin' that's criminal
Put me in the sun, so then I melt
I can cast off the evil eye sent my way

[Refrain]
Ta-ra-ra-rá, ta-ra-rá, ta-ra-rá, ta-ta-á
Ta-ra-ra-ra-ta-tá (I cast it off)
Ta-ra-ra-rá, ta-ra-rá, ta-ra-rá, ta-ta-ta-á
Ta-ra-ra-ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta (I cast it off)

[Verse 1]
Are you the pimp or are you pimped?
I chose my side the day I was born
Are you the pimp or are you pimped?
I chose my side since the day I was born


[Refrain]
Ta-ra-rá, ta-ra-rá, ta-ra-rá, ta-á
Ta-ra-ra-ra-ta-tá (Since the day I was born)

Ta-ra-ra-rá, ta-ra-rá, ta-ra-rá, ta-ta-ta-á
Ta-ra-ra-ra-ta-ta-ta-tá (Since the day I was born)


[Bridge]
Since the day I was born
Since the day I was born
Since the day I was born
Since the day I was born


[Verse 2]
I didn't base my career on making hits
I have hits because I formed the basis

I have nothin' else to say
And it takes a lot of class to say that
My swag makes you dizzy
Even your momma sings along
Who cares if La Mala is givin' me the evil eye
When Haraka always gives me the blessing

Talking bullshit, everything they say phases
And my make-up's the Korean wave
Talking bullshit, everything they say phases
And my make-up's the Korean wave
