## So What is Feature Encoding ?

Before we can train ML models we need to prepare our data for it.
feature encoding is one the data pre processing technique's to convert categorical variables into numerical ones.


## So How do we do that ?

There are two types of categorical variables
- Nominal : don't have any relation like Male and Female
- Ordinal : have an order like Low, Medium and High

here is an example of 
- Nominal Example
- Ordinal Example

use different technique for both Nominal and Ordinal. Generally, we use 

  - Label Encoding for Ordinal
  - One Hot Encoding for Nominal
  
There are other types of encoding as well which you checkout in this notebook.
  - Frequency
  - Binary Encoding
