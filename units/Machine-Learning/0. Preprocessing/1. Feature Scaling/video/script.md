## What is Feature Scaling ?

Scaling Features to be in the same range or have a particular distribution. 

## Why do we scale ?

Scaling the puts all the features in the same range. This helps the ML algorithms to give equal importance to all the features.  

## How do we scale ?
So, generally there are two approaches for scaling

- Normalisation : Puts the data between 0 and 1.
- Standardisation : Transforms the data to have zero mean and unit variance.

Let's take an example and see how they work:
- Example of Normalisation
- Example on Standardisation

#### Side note on RobustScaler
 So, there is one more technique that you can checkout is robust scaler which is usually used when there are outliers in the dataset.
